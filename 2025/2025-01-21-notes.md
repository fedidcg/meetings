# Notes

* [Recharter Formal Objection status](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-review-comments/2024Sep/)  
  * Heather  
     * Still waiting for Council responses  
* IIW (April 8-10) and possible F2F (April 11\)  
  * Heather  
     * Apr 7 is expected to be WG meeting  
     * Apr 11: WebAuthn \+ F2F meeting (½ day each)  
* Ecosystem Updates (5 minutes)  
  * Heather  
     * Would love to hear from IdP/RP implementations and how things are going for people  
     * Anyone want to share today?  
     * (not a lot of IdP folks on the call today)  
     * Will add as a standing item on future calls)  
* [Horizontal Review \- security](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/692)  
  * Heather  
     * Quick update: Simone tagged to review Nicolas and Phil’s contributions  
     * Will get to that shortly  
     * So far seems to be relatively happy with things  
     * Any questions on the security part of horizontal review?  
* Accessibility  
  * Heather  
     * Chatting with Tzviya in W3C to look at early spec  
     * Hopefully someone will help out with that shortly  
  * Wendy  
     * Privacy work being done by Nicolas and Phil along with Security work  
     * Any updates on I18N reviews?  
  * Heather  
     * Yes, review was completed and suggestions made in the repo  
     * Tagged for I18N  
  * Wendy  
     * As we review those we should consider checking in on whether that has resolved the issues that the I18N folks raised  
     * Early TAG review on Architecture piece  
     * When we have an update that warrants TAG review we can do the remaining horizontal reviews  
     * Sustainability review has been mentioned  
     * Also a wide review once the spec is more-or-less in a happy position to ask for the broader community for opinions  
* [Delegation-oriented FedCM](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/677#issuecomment-2594192449) \- move to Stage 1?  
  * Sam  
     * Would like to chat about this, but would like to save enough time for Multi-IdP  
     * Would be good if we had a presentation, but can walk people through the essence of it  
     * Proposal for Stage 1  
     * Stage 1 is a CG stage to explore the space \- one of the earliest stages / infancy  
     * Not sure where it will take us but firm enough to dedicate time to  
     * Most of content is written down in GitHub issue itself (link above)  
     * Contains info collected from previous gatherings  
     * Includes sequence of events that led to choices that were taken and why the delegation oriented model is appropriate now and wasn’t a couple of years ago  
     * Since we started wanted a way to keep IdPs blind to presentation of credentials  
     * Only applicable to Social Login / not as applicable to Academia and probably not applicable at all to Enterprise login  
     * But for social, it seems beneficial to be able to login with the IdP knowing every time  
     * Mediation had been an interim stepping stone for earlier versions of FedCM on the way to Delegated model  
     * Selective Disclosure and Cryptography (Zero Knowledge Proofs and 3-party model where you unbundle issuance from presentation) have all progressed a lot in the last few years.  
     * SD-JWTs in particular seems like the easiest way to get going  
     * BBS+ (sp?) is probably a better long term solution that SD-JWTs  
     * Browser acts as a holder in the 3-party model  
     * Go through the diagram in the repo above  
     * In an incremental way, everything almost is the same as Vanilla FedDCM except for the ID Assertion Endpoint  
     * Fields API / Continuation API / Multi-IdP / Active Mode / etc. are all the same  
     * Just replace Id Assertion Endpoint  
     * Instead of revealing to the IdP who the RP is, don’t do that anymore (need a cooperating IdP and cooperating verifier for this to work)  
     * Instead introduce new endpoint instead of getting id-token or access token, gets a special token that the browser is expected to hold:  
       * For example an SD-JWT / mDoc / BBS+  
     * For SD-JWTs doesn’t reveal who the RP is, browser acts as a holder  
     * Binding it to the audience as well as the challenge (nonce) from the verifier  
     * Browser acting as a holder, uses the Fields API to do selective disclosure and returns an SD-JWT key binding which the RP can use to log the user in  
     * There’s a lot of information in the issue  
     * Need to re-explain SD-JWTs as most people are likely not familiar with them.  
     * If anyone has any issues with the way SD-JWTs  
     * Also looking at mDocs  
     * And Zero Knowledge Proofs with BBS+  
     * Is an upgrade from current Social Logins in that you can use your social identity to sign up / in to websites without the system phoning home to the IdP on each sign up / in  
  * Ben  
     * Have to think about properties of SD-JWTs in this context  
     * Seems like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and BBS+ may be the right long term option  
     * Being able to hide who the RP is from the IdP justifies a lot of design choices around the current Account Chooser UX in FedCM  
  * Sam  
     * Yes \- a lot of the current way that FedCM works fits  
       * Multi-IdP  
       * Fields API  
       * Continuation API  
       * IdP Registration API  
     * We have a prototype in Chrome that seems to fit like a glove with existing design of FedCM  
     * SD-JWTs solves the IdP tracking problem, but have to release global identifiers back  
     * Operates like Drivers Licenses in that it doesn’t “phone home” to the issuer but always has the same identifier that gets used  
     * BBS+ might solve that problem but not sure exactly how  
  * David Waite  
     * Can speak a bit more on BBS+  
     * Ideal have some sort of token where statement of authentication where the issuer / verifier / 3rd party working together still wouldn’t be able to determine who the user is  
     * Want to have a way to say this is valid without the fine-grained aspects that relate back to the token itself  
     * SD-JWTs seems like the right way to go for now and then extend with BBS+ if needed in the future  
  * Sam  
     * There is a structure where browser positions itself as a holder and there are aspects that will be improved as time goes on (in the direction of Zero Knowledge Proofs)  
     * Seems like ZKPs is a topic unto itself  
     * Lots of the people here have their own people working on ZKPs  
     * Microsoft has been working on Crescendo Credentials   
       * ZKPs but not based on BBS+  
     * Not sure how to evaluate those though  
     * Maybe we could have a separate discussion on ZKPs?  
     * Maybe invite experts from IETF on this?  
     * Seems like Martin (Thompson?) is involved in that as well  
     * Also other consideration is relationship between this model and Digital Credentials API  
     * Involved in both APIs so helps to understand each well  
     * Intuition has been not mutually exclusive with the DC API  
     * More of a “yes, and…:” rather than “either or…”  
     * Explainer has explanation of differences between this and DC API  
     * Point of prototypes and incubations to explore  
     * Seems like Delegation Oriented model has different properties than DC  
     * Browser would have a much more active role in Delegation Oriented model than in the DC API mechanism  
     * Think we have a good grasp on how this relates to Passkeys  
     * Unrelated issue where we go over auto-granting passkeys  
     * Maybe use Delegation Oriented model to Sign Up, and auto-grant Passkeys on that Sign-Up event and then use Passkeys for subsequent Sign-Ins  
     * Still under consideration  
     * We have a request to propose this as Stage 1  
     * Would like a repo to put this into for official Stage 1  
  * Heather  
     * Bar for Stage 1 is: is there CG consensus that this is something we should work on  
     * Any objections or concerns for this to be something group explores?  
     * \<no objections\>  
     * Ok \- lets move this to Stage 1 and get this repo created  
     * Will discuss with Sam on setting up a ZKP discussion separate as well  
*  [Add single-get multi IDP support for passive mode \#686](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/686)  
  * Nicolas  
     * Have the PR up (link above) for this  
     * Main thing is currently we wait for all the fetches to be done before building out the FedCM UI and show it (in terms of fetches to .well-known files, etc.)  
     * Currently add UI for this results, then add more UI for that results, etc.  
     * Other than that it seems straightforward, not that controversial  
     * However, Auth-reauthn is currently not available if there are IdP mismatches (ie where login Status for a given IdP is Logged In and then accounts are fetched from that IdP but no accounts are returned)  
     * If there is a single returning account and Mediation is set to “optional” and another IdP resolves to a Mismatched case, then Mutli-IdP FedCM won’t do Auth-Reauthn  
     * Also: Currently only for Passive Mode  
     * Could potentially add for Active Mode, but haven’t fully decided in Active Mode  
     * General agreement that it probably \*should\* work in Active Mode, but not sure if we should specify for both initially or just restrict to Passive Mode  
     * Either option would be Ok / spec wouldn’t change much  
     * It would do the same fetches as in Passive Mode  
     * However, in the case where all IdPs are logged out (but we have to show some UI in Active Mode), we would likely just show an IdP Picker in that case  
     * So that IdP picker would be the main addition if we were to support Active MOde as well  
     * Any comments or questions?  
     * We had Christian as a reviewer  
       * (hasn’t had the chance to look at latest version yet)  
     * Once Christian has reviewed latest version, will ask Ben to review as well  
  * Heather  
     * Any other questions / comments / concerns on direction for this?  
     * (seems like not)  
     * Continue working on what you are doing Nicolas  
* AOB  
  * Heather  
     * PR to update language on process document on how to get things from CG to WG  
     * Had incorporated editorial changes and substantive changes  
     * Trying to pull those apart  
     * In progress still  
     * Sam had been concerned about what were Editorial changes vs. Substantive changes  
     * Encourage people to take a look and let Heather know what you think  
       * [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/Administration/pulls](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/Administration/pulls)  
  * Sam  
     * Re: Deployments of FedCM  
     * We are seeing a growing number of IdPs using FedCM in production which had been previously experimenting  
     * Some are catching us by surprise a bit  
     * In particular Shopify presented to us 6 months ago and came to TPAC last year, and that is materializing into a more solid use of FedCM  
     * And that is for e-commerce rather than Social Logins  
     * Also in other markets (Czechia \[Czech Republic\])  
       * seznam.cz  
     * A lot of people aren’t coming to these calls  
     * Pixie? \- a lot of us don’t know how to use that and doesn’t show up in FEdCM standard  
     * But it would be good to have Shopify come to the CG to present  
  * Heather  
     * I have reached out to Shopify previously   
     * Will reach out again  
     * Is there an email list that people are engaging on?  
  * Sam  
     * A lot of these IdPs engage with Google Developer Relations (DevRel) group  
  * Heather  
     * Could you ask Google DevRel to encourage people to come to the FedID CG?  
  * Sam  
     * Yes – many of the players do not know what a CG is or how to participate  
* IdP Registration  
  * Nicolas  
     * We have a bunch of feature requests for that  
     * Did work on a critical one – skip .well-known enforcement for registered IdPs  
     * Merged that into Chrome Canary \- so it should be able to try that out  
     * If you don’t provide a .well-known file it should still work  
     * If there are other specific features that people need to experiment, let us know  
     * Multi-IdP will take priority for Nicolas in the short term  
     * Will get to IdP Registration as time permits  
  * Sam  
     * It also depends on Multi-IdP?  
  * Nicolas  
     * Yes, they are coupled  
     * Doesn’t make sense to have IdP Registration without Multi-IdP support for actual / general usage.  
     * But if you are blocked on testing IdP Registration, let us know what you are blocked on and we’ll take a look  
  * Heather  
     * Should update the issue – which one?  
  * Nicolas  
     * There’s a repo [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/idp-registration](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/idp-registration)  
* Next week  
  * Tuesday is a WG meeting  
  * CG meeting is on Monday evening  
     * Much less formal / general chatter / but has a place for APAC folks to go
