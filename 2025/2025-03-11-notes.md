# Notes

* Wendy covering Administrivia  
  * Getting us started. Reminder: everybody is part of the FedID CG/WG.  
  * Rejoin CG/WG due to recharter, required within a month.  
  * Remember W3C code of conduct.  
  * Last call for W3C breakout day sessions. TPAC style, but not associated with TPAC. Please propose a session on the GitHub repository  
  * Reminder of the Global Digital Collaboration Conference, 1-2 July, Geneva. Web/Wallet. W3C helps to spread the word and organise breakout sessions. For digital Wallets and Wallet architecture. Chairs will share more info when we have it.   
  * Reminders and admin done  
  * Next Ecosystem updates. Theo to give a demo of Solid FedCM integration  
* Theo:  
  * Sharing screen and demo. [https://fedcm-client.liquid.surf/](https://fedcm-client.liquid.surf/)   
  * Solid is a new web standard created by Tim Berners-Lee. “Personal online datastore, POD”.  
  * Solid server can store application data and is an IdP.  
  * Interested in FedCM and the IdP registration feature. That will present a better UX as each user has their own POD and their own IdP (BYOIDP).  
  * Delegate authn to the Solid server.  
  * Try to fetch a protected resource and it fails.  
  * Now login to the Solid IdP. Trigger IdP registration and sign in to the Solid server.   
  * Back at the RP, click on login with FedCM. Does not show an email address; instead you have a WebID (PS ?) in the accounts popup.  
  * FedCM performs the authentication flow and the token is presented to the RP; you can now access the protected resource.   
  * For implementation:  
    * Was tricky to get the authorization code out of …  
    * Solid server uses a Node.js OIDC OP, that is made to be used with user interaction, not directly work with FedCM.  
    * Tricky to find a simple way to get auth\_code from this library. The library is meant to add endpoints to your express app and then get auth\_code from those endpoints. Eventually found a way to get it to respond with the auth\_code by inspecting the code and figuring out a way to do it.  
    * So a bit tricky on the backend.  
    * Demo done  
* Wendy:  
  * Any questions?   
  * Code is available  
* Theo:  
  * Can look at Theo’s code to find out how to add an auth\_code in node.js  
  * [https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/fedcm-demo](https://github.com/Liquid-Surf/fedcm-demo)   
* Sam  
  * This is cool\! Three questions:  
    * Is there anything else you feel the browser could help with, a wish list for the browser?  
    * I could use an expansion on how you represent users. Not names, but URLs?  
    * Is this available in production, can I try this, or is this experimental? Is important we make IdP registration work when other browsers do not support it. What would it take to run in production, if not?  
* Theo:  
  * If just flipping a flag, then people can use it. What do you mean by backwards compatible?  
* Sam:  
  * Can you point me to a URL to reproduce what you just did?  
* Theo:  
  * Yes  
* Sam:  
  * Paste URL? [https://fedcm-client.liquid.surf/](https://fedcm-client.liquid.surf/)  
  * Instructions?  
* Theo:  
  * There are instructions on the demo page.   
  * You can create your own account on the Community Solid Server.  
  * Happy to hear feedback on the GitHub repo  
  * One thing that makes it not production yet, is the key? (PS, not sure).   
    * Issues with SameSite cookies (None v Lax to make this work).   
    * Solid is experimental right now.  
  * The browser can help: new to OIDC, made it work in the end, this shows there is good documentation.  
  * How to represent users: If I trigger the FedCM login, the WebID is too long for the popup box, so could not use the full ID. In the future…you also add vcard elements so we could show that as well. There is also an email address which links to your webID, so maybe those could be used instead.  
  * Did I answer your question, Sam? (Sam) yes it does. (Theo) Thanks for your help, Sam.   
* Wendy:  
  * Thank you, that was helpful.   
  * Great to see deployments.  
  * Any other ecosystem updates? RPs or IdPs?  
    * … nope  
  * Items from the design team, two issues added to the agenda.   
* **Next Up:** FedCM "core": move "extensions" out of the current spec into an independent spec: [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703):  
  * (Wendy) Sam?  
* Sam:  
  * Last meeting inside the design team. The intent was to break the spec into ‘core’ and ‘extensions’. ‘Core’ is a subset of the current spec that Chrome and Firefox would implement. ‘Extensions’ are the features only one browser engine would implement. I took a quick pass at the spec to do that, but would appreciate input from the group if I got that right.  
* Mike:  
  * Defining the content of specs by what browsers do or do not implement seems like a fluid and arbitrary definition. Seems better to have everything in the spec and later see what is implemented or not. Or have criteria for stuff. But what is implemented by browsers is too fluid and will change over time.  
* Sam:  
  * W3C candidate recommendation requires two independent browser implementations.   
* Mike:  
  * In other W3C documents, if it does not have two implementations, mark ‘at risk’ rather than remove it.   
* Sam:  
  * Not against that. Do not feel too strongly about it. Happy to mark things inside the same spec.  
  * How to structure it?  
* Mike:  
  * The VC WG just added an "at risk" marker in the spec, which has a source code for that.  
  * W3C requirement is not that two browsers implement things, but that there be two ‘implementations’.   
* Sam:  
  * So you're saying, a single spec that defines all of it, but inside the spec, mark which parts are at risk and which parts are not at risk.   
* Mike:  
  * Yes. Easier for developers  
* Sam:  
  * Got it. Seems OK for Chrome  
* Mike:  
  * A link: https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703  
* Sam:  
  * What do others think?  
* Ben:  
  * This is interesting. One document of these are the things you can rely on, and another with things that you cannot seem easier to implement.  
  * Implementation in this case means web engines.   
* Wendy:  
  * Have not been participating with the design teams. But this could be used as a heuristic to decide…what do we see multiple implementations working on, even if not right now. They should signal that this is a feature they find important and would like to see in the core. From the W3C process, when we go to candidate recommendation we need to demonstrate two independent implementations.   
  * I hear Mike on what is easier for people to follow, and the same from Ben.  
  * Also, use [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703) to identify the features of concern.   
    * People take a look at the features, and see which ones you like as a developer or an IdP/RP, which make the spec useful for your purpose, and which you do not mind if some browsers implement and some don’t.   
* Sam:  
  * FWIW, one thing I like from Mike’s proposal is it makes it more likely some extensions will make their way into core.  
* Mike:  
  * Also helps not having to move things between two specs.  
* Sam:  
  * Mike, what about WebAuthn. Is that similar.  
* Mike:  
  * Before recommendation we pull stuff out if not implemented by 2, but pre-candidate recommendation we leave them in.  
* Sam:  
  * Are we are pre-candidate recommendation?  
* Mike:  
  * Yes, that is why I suggest keeping them in one spec for now.  
* Ted:  
  * Is looking up how it is done now  
  * "at risk" language is visible at [https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/blob/db8fa5b3fdddc044050c8a3bf8e6814f10639de7/transitions/2024/CR1/index.html\#L4704-L4711](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/blob/db8fa5b3fdddc044050c8a3bf8e6814f10639de7/transitions/2024/CR1/index.html#L4704-L4711)  
* Wendy:  
  * We have a big spec, and there are limited resources to work on implementation. That is a fact of the web. So we want to see how to use your attention here (in the CG/ WG), to see what to focus on to make this a useful API.   
  * Perhaps looking in the design team what to keep in core and what niche things to pull out.  
  * Can some be prioritised or some deprioritised?   
  * Please look at the issue [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/703) and share your thoughts and reviews.  
* **Next up** is FedCM "core": break Web Platform tests between "core" and "extensions": [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/704](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/704)  
* Wendy:  
  * Anything you want to add on 704  
* Sam  
  * Intent to use web platform tests to help define what ‘core’ is  
  * Using web platform tests to make sure web platforms interoperate.   
  * WebDriver used by Chrome to test their API and RPs  
  * Anybody with testing experience we would love your help  
* Wendy:  
  * Horizontal review preparation\!  
  * Need accessibility reviews, we need somebody to start to look at that.  
  * Please if you can help us spearhead the accessibility review. There is a lot of material to help groups do their internal self-review. It needs somebody from our side to pick up those issues and get it started.   
  * Security and Privacy reviews are still ongoing.   
* **Next up** is PR 669: [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/669\#issuecomment-2704261675](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/669#issuecomment-2704261675)  
* Christian:  
  * New proposal about the name not being consistent.   
  * If no comments soon, will update the spec PR with the current suggestion  
* Wendy:  
  * If you have strong feelings about naming, please take a look at that PR  
  * AOB?  
  * April 11th WG. Hybrid meeting from IIW. Trying for a time on Friday that does not conflict with WebAuthn and DC WG meetings.   
  * What is the DC WCG asking us to adopt?  
  * Closing the meeting.
