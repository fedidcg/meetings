# Notes

* Formal Rejection on Charter  
  * Simone  
    * “Soon” (they will provide an answer soon — hopefully by end of this week — maybe — hopefully)  
* half-day F2F meeting in Mountain View  
  * April 11th, 2025  
  * Same week as IIW  
* Heather  
  * Any other IdPs or people experimenting with FedCM?  
  * Seems like OnePassword is doing something, but not on call at the moment  
  * (no other people, it seems)  
* Shopify  
  * Gioele  
    * Demo \+ 2 slides  
    * \<sharing screen\>  
    * I’m engineer on Sign-In-With-Shop team  
    * Have 2 IdPs with Shopify  
    * One is more merchant-facing — won’t talk about that  
    * Other one is buyer-facing  
    * It’s called: Sign-In-With-Shop  
    * \<showing TPAC breakout session slides\>  
    * TLDR: We launched FedCM on Shop’s classic customer account page  
    * Need to understand why a buy would sign in vs. not sign in  
    * Example of a store  
    * Usual shopping journey / buy products  
    * Each individual store has customer account session  
    * Merchants have full control over appearance of store  
    * Have a customer account section  
    * Can see orders, manage subscriptions, etc.  
    * Traditionally (before sign-in-with-shop) had to create an account  
    * One account per store — username password  
    * Sub-optimal experience  
    * So, launched sign-in-with-shop  
    * Powers shop account using federated identity  
    * Usual way, type email, in background check to see if email belongs to shop account  
    * And then if so, it puts up a dialog to prompt user / ask user if they want to continue  
    * If not already signed in (trying with another account that isn’t) you will get SMS OTC  
    * Default user experience before FedCM  
    * With FedCM: upon landing on page, call FedCM passive mode API and render dialog at top right  
    * User clicks on the account and then sign-in is automatic  
    * That’s what is currently launched  
    * Any questions on use-case?  
    * (no questions)  
    * Numbers:  
    * Users 50% more likely to sign in when sign-in with shop — Using federated identity is so much easier  
    * 130K RPs / stores have experienced at least one user signing in with FedCM  
    * Multiple ways to sign in  
    * Username / passwords, FedCM  
    * FedCM is \~10% of sign-ins  
    * 300K sign-ins per week  
    * In terms of conversion:  
      * Denominator: User saw a prompt (FedCM), etc.  
      * Numerator: Users did sign in  
      * 24% Conversion rate  
      * Difficult to determine whether the modal actually showed in the GIS One-Tap case, so GIS One-Tap sign-ins are not as precise  
      * Hard to say whether that’s good or bad  
      * Will run experiments to determine how it compares to other sign-in methods  
      * Currently have 3P cookies enabled  
      * Have alternate sign-in method that is similar to One-Tap, but custom to Shopify (bespoke)  
      * That UI converts at double the rate of the FeDCM UI  
      * Interesting to determine why  
      * Possible reasons: Shopify branding exists  
      * Positioning differences (bespoke one is front / center of the screen)  
      * Also, it greys out the screen behind  
      * Active mode converts better, so user intention is definitely a factor, too  
    * 3P cookies allow Shopify to do a lot more  
    * But they are likely to go away for reasons  
    * So FedCM provides an alternative  
    * When user signs in on storefront, they are authenticated on that store  
    * Merchant then knows who the user is and can improve shopping journey  
    * E.g., Shopping for cactus  
    * We could have banner to promise that cactus can be delivered in X days  
    * But need to know where you live in order to provide accurate shipping info.  
    * Without sign-in, can use IP to roughly determine location  
    * But still not accurate enough  
    * With sign-in, they will be able to know exact location  
    * Also, NASCAR flag problem for wallet selection  
    * With sign-in, could limit the list of possible wallets to only those appropriate for the user instead of ALL the wallets  
    * Also: Can offer discount codes to the user  
    * When signed-in, can determine whether the user has a discount code and auto-apply it to purchase  
    * Any questions why I'm excited about FedCM?  
    * Also excited about Mozilla and Apple to join FedCM to be able to provide it on other browsers  
  * Phil  
    * Seems there are multiple ways to sign in  
      * FedCM  
      * Iframe / bespoke version  
      * Active Mode (of FEdCM)  
  * Gioele  
    * Looking at Fenced Frames as a possible solution  
    * Lots of questions from users along the lines of “do I even have a Shop account??”  
    * Difficult to throw a random button into a sea of buttons and hope the user clicks on *that* button  
    * Of course, we could throw a frame on the page  
    * But that will go away with 3P cookies  
    * Fenced Frames has a way to bring forward to user about whether they are authenticated or not  
    * Not really waiting for Fenced frames; still excited about the prospect of the UI  
    * Also planning to ship FedCM on many more pages of the storefront and other pages in the store  
  * Phil  
    * Would you say that you’d eventually streamline this into one method or pop-up flow?  
    * As there are currently multiple ways to sign in  
  * Gioele  
    * Definitely an ideal scenario — but not sure how easy it would be to do that in practice due to the number of sign ins   
  * Zach  
    * Following up on putting it on more pages  
    * In check-out page, in passive mode you could pre-populate the page  
    * Is that an idea?  
  * Gioele  
    * That is one of the pages that is evaluated  
    * People who are already authenticated with Shop Pay, tend to check out with Shop Pay  
    * If signed up with FedCM or otherwise authenticated on Shop Page  
    * When trying to buy item, automatically taken to Shop checkout page  
    * FedCM is only valuable when user is already signed in (to IdP), so not the main focus of use cases  
    * But still a good question (and have been asked this internally too)  
    *   
    * Continuing…  
    * Calculating sign-in conversion rate is hard — can’t determine how often the FedCM modal is actually shown  
    * Exfil attacks  
    * Big Kudos to Aaron\!  
    * How to secure the FeDCM IdP-to-RP exchange  
    * Talked to Aaron for more info  
    * We accept the fact that stores are compromised  
    * Merchants can install 3P apps on their stores and those apps have access to top-frame JS  
    * Merchants control what they want  
    * Don’t know if there are malicious actors eavesdropping on JS thread  
    * Concerned about id-token making it all the way back to the JS side of the RP page  
    * Esp. if someone can intercept the token, they could exfiltrate that token to their device and impersonate the user on a separate device  
    * But — safe if PKCE is implemented correctly  
    * Will make sure authenticating flow starts and ends on the same device  
    * Drops HTTP-only cookie on the device and that will contain bits to tie back conversation with the token  
    * This wasn’t clear when we implemented the FedCM flow  
    * Shopify team doesn’t think implementation of FedCM is particularly difficult  
    * But the edges surrounding FedCM are somewhat more concerning (exfiltration attacks, etc.)  
    * The PKCE flow was not immediately obvious as a potential solution   
    * Aaron was very helpful  
  * Phil  
    * Having a way to send it directly to the RP without being in JS (i.e., whether the RP had an endpoint and did not involve JS at all) is interesting  
    * See a lot of FedCM implementations that just take the token and post it back to the RP’s server  
  * Gioele  
    * That’s safe if the RP owns all the JS on the page  
  * Phil  
    * Client-side JS is important if there are client-side JS calls  
    * But a lot of implementations are server-side only, so token doesn’t really need to be on the client in JS at all  
  * Gioele  
    * Back-channel communications architecture would definitely ease adoption as it is very common  
  * Aaron Parecki  
    * Definitely a good idea\!  
    * Everything from FedCM design seems JS centric  
    * But that just leads to the issues we are seeing  
    * Pushing it to server-side by default, HTTP, back-channels, generally keep stuff out of JS would be better  
  * Sam  
    * All those things are perfectly reasonable to consider and expose server-side constructs by default  
    * Does raise a bit of a branding question  
    * (Aaron has best high-level view)  
    * Impossible to implement a complete system  
    * Needs OAuth or SAML system to do the actual token management  
    * PKCE is not mentioned at all in FedCM documentation  
    * Do people have opinions on how to improve?  
  * Aaron  
    * A lot of other browser APIs are JS APIs  
    * And things that come from the browser should not be trusted  
    * Form fields need to be validated server-side  
    * With FedCM, however, it’s not positioned that way  
    * But if it is positioned as “fancy autofill”, that will show people that they should do more server-side validation  
  * Sam  
    * If we had OAuth profile published, then we could point people to it  
  * Aaron  
    * Interesting question about where that should be published  
    * Not clear whether that should live in W3C-land or IETF-land  
  * Sam  
    * Good question  
    * Initially thought that IETF would be a good home  
  * Aaron  
    * Very little about Brower APIs in IETF  
    * Some OAuth Profile mentions browser APIs  
    * But it’s so tied to FedCM, it seems like a special case  
  * Sam  
    * Open to starting that in FedID WG as possible Best Practice on how to use FedCM with OAuth?  
  * Aaron  
    * Yes, seems reasonable  
  * Sam  
    * Will work with FedCM docs folks  
  * Phil  
    * If RP could describe endpoints for FedCM, then RP could also define Logout endpoints  
    * Currently there aren’t any endpoints that RPs surface for Logouts  
    * Logouts are therefore currently much messier / more involved in JS side  
  * Gioele  
    * Concludes presentation  
    * Very excited at Shopify  
    * Starting to Explore where FedCM could  be used in other places  
    * Want to improve sign-in conversion, so opportunity to do better branding is something we’d like  
    * Also would like to expose FedCM on more User Agents than just Chrome  
    * Those are key take-aways  
* Heather  
  * Had meant to give quick update  
  * Last week we talked about having design team to figure out a core spec for FedCM would have (omitting parts that don’t have complete consensus)  
  * Design team met for 90 minutes yesterday  
  * A lot more homework to do  
  * But a lot of progress was already made  
  * Core spec will include Accounts Pull, Active Mode, Continuation API, \<other API\> , IdP Assertion Endpoint, Params API  
  * Not in core: Passive Mode, Fields API  
  * That’s the starting point  
  * Group will come together in 2 weeks to discuss further  
  * Then will come back to CG and WG before things are moved much further ahead  
* Heather  
  * A couple of open issues  
  * Chrome team: what issues / priorities would you like to discuss?  
  * \<no preferences\>  
* Zach  
  * Q: Sorry — about the UX — are Digital credentials UX part of this? Or will only be once the groups (specifications) are merged?  
  * Understanding is that Digital Credentials will be pulled into FedCM  
  * Is UX work now just for FedCM?  And not for how Digital Credentials will work overall?  
* Heather  
  * No plan to bring DC into FedCM — DC will exist independently from FeDCM, in general  
* Christian  
  * UX is generally up to the browsers, not in spec  
* Sam  
  * Welcome to come to the WICG where Digital Credentials is discussed in details  
  * People can review existing DC UX  
* Heather  
  * Next week is Asia/Pacific call so maybe harder to join  
  * Next Atlantic call (of WICG) is March 10th  
* IdP Branding  
  * [Issue 679 — IdentityProviderBranding field name should provide lang and direction](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/679)  
  * Christian  
    * Didn’t we talk about this last week?  
    * After discussing with some people, adding direction is not harmful, but not sure if it is useful  
  * Ben  
    * Generally agree  
  * Christian  
    * Chrome’s UI code doesn’t really do that for the UI part but could be changed  
    * On MacOS, the voiceover screen reader will change languages as appropriate  
    * Esp. useful for IdP name — language and direction makes sense  
  * Heather  
    * Is this an AI for Spec changes?  
  * Christian  
    * Yes, we’ll create a Spec PR for this change  
* Horizontal Review  
  * Heather  
    * Still to do and waiting for volunteers  
    * Would like to get first pass done  
    * Let Heather know if you want to work on that  
* Use Another Account  
  * [Issue 678 — Specify "Use another account"](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/678)  
  * Christian  
    * Saw Ben’s latest comment  
    * Might end up agreeing with Ben on this one on and only using it for Active MOde  
    * More discussions currently uin progress  
    * But Ben’s is a good point  
  * Heather  
    * Doesn’t sound like any particular action item  
    * Come back for discussion next week?  
  * Christian  
    * Seems like no, esp if we agree with Ben  
    * Unless someone else disagrees with it  
  * Heather  
    * Any other questions / Concerns?  
    * None  
* Allow User Agent to … or reject request before fetch  
  *  [Issue 676 — Allow user agent to wait or reject the request before any fetch](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/676)  
  * Heather  
    * Looks like changes were made in PR and no further discussions  
    * Any questions / concerns  
  * Christian  
    * Nicolas may not be on phone today  
  * Heatherh  
    * Seems like it is only waiting on Sam’s review  
  * Christian  
    * Would be good to have non-Googler review it  
    * Don’t think principle is controversial  
  * Heather  
    * Leave it Agenda+’d and discuss when Nicolas is back on the call next week?  
* [PR 669 — Specify account labels](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/pull/669)  
  * Christian  
    * Added a comment where we think that labeling accounts is useful  
    * Not sure if that was enough to convince Ben?  
  * Ben  
    * Having this makes sense  
    * Maybe a bit more bikeshedding around Domain Hint, Login Hint and just have it center around the idea  
    * Both of those operate around the concept of “if the account matches this thing” then allow it in the list  
    * But this has both allow and exclude semantics, so have the name match the semantics better  
    * Whenever we update Spec PR it would be good to have Ben’s approval  
    * Assuming that is the case and no one else has any opinions, plan is to just merge it  
  * Heather  
    * Seems fine — don’t necessarily need to bring it back for discussion in the future  
* Heather  
  * Process PR will go to top of Agenda next week  
  * Also the Delegation API repo will come up next week also  
  * If anyone else has any things to discuss, use the Agenda+ tag in the Issue
