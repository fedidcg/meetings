# Notes

  - WG Formation Process Status
    
      - About to progress to next phase
    
      - Philippe took a look at the draft charter that has been in
     public comment for 2 weeks
    
      - Aligned last week — will go to AC review as next steps
    
      - Need to fix up a couple of items
    
      - Made a few changes to Charter to conform with standard
     templates
    
      - Previously had added Web Platform Tests into Normative
     requirements — those were not in the right palace so they are
     now in the “Other Deliverables” part
    
      - Using standard text for tests as well
    
      - Login Status API had been listed as a separate deliverable
    
      - But that is now part of FedCM so removed
    
      - Christian: Sam wanted this to be separate
    
      - Philippe: Asking where the Login Status API document
    
      - Sam Goto:
        
          - Two ways that Login Status API is documented
        
          - Explainer (link)
        
          - Spec — currently embedded into the FedCM Spec
        
          - But that’s just because that’s easiest to start from
        
          - But intuition is that that should be in a separate spec to
         allow browser vendors could implement it independently
         from implementing FedCM
        
          - FedCM depends on Login Status API, but it is somewhat
         independent of core FedCM
    
      - Philippe:
        
          - Once WG is started, we can take the spec and split into as
         many modules as we want — no problem
        
          - Happy to have a separate deliverable and link to the
         particular section of the FedCM spec if required, but that
         would make it a bit awkward for review purposes
    
      - Sam:
        
          - Making it separate things makes it transparent to, in
         particular, Apple engineers that they are separate aspects
    
      - Philippe
        
          - Sounds good — we will carve it out
    
      - BenVS:
        
          - Perhaps useful to have versions of specs listed out
    
      - Philippe:
        
          - That can be done in WG once it has been form
        
          - I will add separate line for Login Status API and note the
         intention is that it will be pulled out as separate
         deliverables
    
      - Sam:
        
          - BenVS: Are you imagining a separate spec that will be
         implemented by at least two browsers?
    
      - Philippe:
        
          - Not necessarily - Charter says that we will continue to
         work closely with the CG
        
          - Details are up to us to figure out
        
          - Doesn’t need to be in the Charter
    
      - Achim
        
          - Better to be general
        
          - CG might feel it is left out — but the text as is
    
      - Philippe
        
          - Already have several examples of other CGs / WGs on how
         they work together
    
      - BenVS:
        
          - If it ended up being confusing we could have a GitHub
         draft spec, but sounds like that is not needed.
    
      - Achim
        
          - Also looked at timeline
        
          - Seemed a bit shallow / inconclusive as it only listed date
         of first meeting
        
          - Wanted to pinpoint a time, given the existing long time of
         incubation
        
          - Wanted WG to do a first candidate recommendation
        
          - Which doesn’t need to answer all the questions that are
         asked
        
          - Aim is to publish that candidate recommendation in Q1 2024
        
          - And then go to recommendation by Q1 2025
    
      - Philippe
        
          - If we manage that timeline, that would be great /
         surprising
    
      - Sam:
        
          - What are candidate recommendation requirements?
    
      - Philippe
        
          - Needs to be feature complete
    
      - Sam
        
          - Any implementation requirements?
    
      - Philippe
        
          - You need to say what you will actually do for the
         implementation, but an actual implementation isn't
         required.
        
          - Might need to debate that between ourselves in terms off
         exactly which features will make it in
    
      - Achim
        
          - Success criteria we reverted to the standard text /
         language in
        
          - (had previously leaned on the wrong inputs — corrected
         now)
        
          - Last thing was the antitrust section — in there because we
         leaned on private advertising WG draft, but removed
         completely because everyone is subject to W3C antitrust
         policies — doesn’t need to be mentioned explicitly.
        
          - That’s it
        
          - If no objections, we can move to next stage which is AC
         review which is final stage before formation of WG
    
      - Philippe
        
          - That’s correct — is if no more comments will start that
        
          - Minimum 28 days of review, and if that is successful,
         should be able to form WG
    
      - Achim
        
          - Next need to plan Breakout Days
        
          - There are virtual breakout days similar to physical ones
         that happen at TPAC
        
          - Next ones are in mid-March — Heather suggested that we
         might want to discuss FedCM in the breakout days
    
      - Sam
        
          - Excited about Virtual Breakout days — similar to
         lightweight TPAC
        
          - Should take advantage of this
        
          - Make connections across groups as opposed to just within
         ourselves
        
          - Maybe make some cross-WG
        
          - How to think about our work in conjunction with Wallet
         work in other CGs
        
          - How to think about our work in conjunction with WebAuthn
         and other related CGs (Payments?)
    
      - Philippe
        
          - Using this as an opportunity is good
        
          - In the Virtual Meeting Days in March, won’t be able to
         meet people, but could still start to involve people in
         WebAuthn and Payments
        
          - But also TPAC in September in Anaheim could meet a lot of
         cross-groups there
    
      - Achim
        
          - Yes, TPAC very useful
        
          - Other suggestions?
    
      - Philippe
        
          - We will have advisory committee meeting in April (twice
         per year)
        
          - One representative from each member
        
          - Good opportunity to present this work to membership at
         large at the next meeting.
    
      - Sam
        
          - Another thing — excited to talk to BenVS about:
            
              - Chrome starting to give guidance to Web Ecosystem on
             how to transition away from 3P cookies
        
          - Somewhat unsatisfied by that guidance
        
          - Chrome supports Related Web Sites (RWS)
        
          - Guidance is to use RWS if possible, otherwise use FedCM
        
          - But that is somewhat satisfying as it may not work
         smoothly / automatically with all browsers (FireFox and
         Safari)
        
          - Also some suggestions to Storage Access API in that
         guidance as well (combination of those techniques to
         continue functioning after 3P cookie deprecation)
    
      - BenVS
        
          - Makes sense — would like to have that conversation?
    
      - Achim
        
          - Would that be good for the Virtual Breakouts?
    
      - Sam
        
          - Yes — could have us and PrivacyCG (Kaustubha Govind /
         Johann Hofmann / etc.) would be great
    
      - BenVS
        
          - Yes — having some sort of recommendations for Post-3P
         Cookie WEb would be great
        
          - And having representation from Mozilla would be good too
    
      - Achim
        
          - Two potential session
            
              - Guidance around fed id without 3p cookies
            
              - Alignment session on what the group is doing in
             general
            
              - Will need to file github for these session proposals /
             align on sessions
    
      - Sam
        
          - On the theme of bringing people from various places, John
         Bradley — in the meeting?
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Yes here
    
      - Sam
        
          - Other interaction would be with OID Foundation
        
          - (Phil and SAML community as well?)
        
          - Starting to get worried a bit as 3P cookie deprecation
         happening, more and more developers are starting to use
         FedCM
        
          - And we’re seeing a lot more smaller IdPs are using FedCM
         rather than larger IdPs
        
          - FedCM is designed to be un-opinionated on what exact
         protocol is passed back and forth.
        
          - Larger IDPs can do security reviews etc to ensure FedCM
         operates correctly with their large systems
        
          - But FedCM for smaller players could cause more anxiety as
         FedCM principles are not technically part of SAML and
         OpenID Connect
        
          - So, would like better integration of FedCM into SAML and
         OpenID Connect
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Reason we don’t talk about FedCM in specs written 10 years
         ago is obvious
        
          - However, developing some profiles have certain concerns on
         deployments of OIDC and SAML have concerns, in particular
         with Identity Proxies being used in various configurations
         (SP Proxies in SAML) that are independent of FedCM but are
         cause for discussion.
        
          - E.g., Naive implementation where you have an IdP and SP
         can probably be addressed by most recent specs, but
         existing SAML and OIDC specs will still need to consider
         FedCM
    
      - Matthew Economu
        
          - What has changed wrt SAML and FedCM, as to date FedCM has
         not been suitable for SAML (at least it hasn’t been
         advertised as such)
    
      - Sam
        
          - Nothing’s changed — we are not aware of any requirements
         for SAML federation for FedCM
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Certainly not limited to SAML - lots of deployments use
         intermediate proxies in front of a bunch of RPs or SPs or
         Content providers
        
          - IDProxies with 2 or 3 in an authentication chain is not
         uncommon
        
          - For example proxies in front of Ping or MS Authentication
    
      - Matthew
        
          - That’s is a trivial example in my world
        
          - But it’s all first party
        
          - What impact does FedCM have on 1st party interactions
    
      - Achim
        
          - Nothing at the moment — you continue doing it as you have
         done
        
          - Bounce-checking mitigations might have been affected
        
          - Might need to reauthenticate
        
          - Existing bounce flows may not work — so FedCM isn’t
         necessarily a direct alternative; it might not work
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - If ad-tracking prevention causes issues with
         redirect-based Authentication, FedCM as it is currently
         may not be adequate
        
          - Also, IdP discovery requires 3P cookies
        
          - If you have 10,000 IDPs and that case is not addressed,
         could end up effectively breaking (effectively made
         unusable)
    
      - Matthew
        
          - We could diagram this? Typical configs
    
      - Sam
        
          - Deviating from multiple facets of the problem
        
          - SAML and OIDC have been developed over 10–15 years
        
          - So likely won’t be able to come up with anything that
         would work comprehensively right on day 1
        
          - Approach is to incrementally build a solution step by step
         — of course, there will be use-cases that will be missed
         as we go
        
          - So, for sure, FedCM as it is now does not cover all the
         use cases
        
          - Want to avoid analysis paralysis with this approach
        
          - So far we see a subset of use-cases that are used widely
         in production that break with 3P cookie deprecation
        
          - Doesn’t support the full range of use-case of all of SAML
         and OIDC
        
          - Want to make sure the subset that is being developed is
         safe
        
          - Want to re-use the decades of research that has gone into
         SAML and OIDC as much as possible
    
      - Achim
        
          - Conscious of agenda time
        
          - If there is a 3rd proposal to do interactions with related
         standards — and find someone and engage with those people
        
          - Maybe use breakouts to have conversations on these topics
        
          - Not sure if it should be just security properties as FedCM
         covers many more aspects
        
          - Let’s turn to, Issue \#240 - Christian?
    
      - Christian
        
          - Actually wanted to discuss Issue \#537
    
      - Achim
        
          - Who flagged \#240?
    
      - Sam
        
          - Could be an old one
    
      - Christian
        
          - Ok - Issue \#537
        
          - Currently Login Status can only be set if IDP is all
         same-origin
        
          - However, an IDP runs its IDP login on one subdomain but
         runs FedCM on another subdomain
        
          - Proposing to fix this by allowing FedCM and IDP to be
         same-site not restricting it to same-origin
        
          - Don’t think it is a problem, as cookies are already
         same-site capable
    
      - BenVS
        
          - Doesn’t immediately seem to be problematic on the surface,
         but needs to think more detailed about this
    
      - Christian
        
          - We have a Spec PR for this for review and further feedback
    
      - Achim
        
          - Issue \#390 — Multiple IDPs
    
      - Yi
        
          - Nicolas made lots of progress on this over the past week
        
          - Should be able to try this out in Chrome Canary
        
          - Probably don’t want to test Multi-IDP with Button Flow as
         Button Flow is still being developed
        
          - Currently — no way for RP caller (of the
         Identity.credentials.get() call) to know which IDP the
         identity came from when the user selects an identity
        
          - Currently just pass back an id-token from the .get() call
        
          - Perhaps in the token we could add an IDP identifier?
    
      - Achim
        
          - Or maybe id-tokens is usually signed by an IDP
        
          - Can look at the issuer of the token
    
      - Wanpeng
        
          - Might be possible to trick RP
        
          - Submit code to another IDP — if RP misunderstands code for
         one IDP could submit to another IDP and that IDP could
         intercept it
        
          - Called “IDP Mixup Attack”
        
          - In OAuth — used only check the domain — now check the
         entire URL to avoid this issue
        
          - Needs to be addressed in API design — otherwise some cases
         that could be attacked
        
          - Id-token *should* be ok
        
          - If “audience” is part of request / response that could be
         verified
        
          - So maybe return client-id in addition to id-token from the
         FedCM API
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Pixie was one of the examples
        
          - FedCM and OIDC are very loosely related — basically just
         the passing back and forth of an id-token
        
          - FedCM works well with social login systems (Sign-In with
         Google, Facebook, etc.)
        
          - But with greater levels of protection required, more
         checks on both sides are required
        
          - It might be that FedCM in these cases might just be used
         for IDP discovery, and then an actual OIDC exchange
         happens after that
        
          - How the two things work together (in more extended cases)
         will have to be worked out
        
          - All the mitigations in OIDC on how to use access tokens,
         etc. Haven’t been
    
      - Phil Smart
        
          - FedCM doesn’t allow authentication of RP, just
         authenticating the origin
        
          - Seems to be the same way that Google Identity Service is
         using it as well
        
          - FedCM doesn’t say anything about using Pixie codes or
         other authentication systems
        
          - Would need to be explored in more detail
        
          - Looks like the implicit flow in OIDC
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Implicit flow has now been deprecated in OIDC
        
          - Might be useful for people to OIDC Advanced Profile that
         many banks in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc., are now looking
         at
        
          - Has almost no connect to naive implementation of OIDC
    
      - Achim
        
          - Goes back to Sam’s point
        
          - Channel that FedCM opens between the RP and IDP is just a
         channel
        
          - But likely needs to be additional guidance
        
          - Might not even end up sending an id-token due other
         reasons
        
          - Might just push through a short term code
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - People overuse “id-token”
        
          - What gets returned as a signed token with a bunch of
         claims in it
        
          - That’s the first step of a profile that then allows mutual
         recognition of RP and IDP and then subsequent allowing of
         logging in with keys, etc.
        
          - Naive implementation might do entire transaction in that
         token
        
          - But in more sophisticated situations that is just the
         first step of a more extensive authentication
         conversation.
    
      - BenVS
        
          - Ties into Sam’s earlier point
        
          - Needs better guidance on how to use this safely / how to
         not use it unsafely
    
      - Sam
        
          - Even if it is not the browser’s responsibility to police
         this, it could still help
    
      - Achim
        
          - The id-token is intentionally left opaque for this reason
    
      - John Bradley
        
          - Concern is that if you squint, FedCM has the appearance of
         providing something stronger than what it actually does
         provide (from a strong authentication perspective).
        
          - Might be good to clarify that in the docs?
    
      - Achim
        
          - Will push Issue \#240 to next week
