-   New implementation -
[<u>https://indieweb.org/FedCM\_for\_IndieAuth</u>](https://indieweb.org/FedCM_for_IndieAuth)

    -   **Aaron Parecki** has been working with FedCM and the open web
    model

    -   Register IdP in browser and bring it to websites that may not
    have a preexisting relationship with the IdP

    -   Discussion in the Repo and issues: small tweaks and a few things
    needed to be resolved

    -   Test example site for comments for blogs

    -   \[demo time from
    [<u>https://aaronparecki.com/</u>](https://aaronparecki.com/)\]

    -   Initial step was take the personal IdP (IndieAuth Provider) and
    register it.

    -   <img src="media/20240521-image1.png" style="width:21.33333in;height:10.67708in" />

        -   Screen grab shows the RP site and the FedCM request to authN
        via the registered Indie Auth provider.

    -   Link
    [<u>https://indieweb.org/FedCM\_for\_IndieAuth</u>](https://indieweb.org/FedCM_for_IndieAuth)
    is for those familiar with Indie Auth new to FedCM. See link
    outs to GitHub issues.

        -   Returns an OAuth authorization code and the OAuth server
        metadata endpoint. Allows RP to receive the endpoint to
        understand what is available to define capabilities, etc.

        -   Current Canary does return identityCredential.configURL
        which could also be referenced. But that may require more
        definitions (for inclusion of the OAuth server metadata
        URL in the configURL).

    -   Phil: when you register the IdP is the browser validating the
    metadata? Aaron: Yes. (Note from Aaron: I was apparently
    wrong, see \[this
    comment\](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/240\#issuecomment-2122944504)
    from Sam)

    -   It does use the logged-in state.

    -   This only works with user interaction. (Although the motivation
    for the interaction could be tricky)

    -   Aaron thinks there will be many IdPs and so “is logged in” IdPs
    should be filterable. Banking IdPs, Enterprise, personal, etc

    -   Sam also is on it
    [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/593</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/593)

    -   George Fletcher: is it feasible to layer other aspects from a
    flow perspective?

        -   Authorization code creates interesting capabilities allowing
        server side integrations, other flows. Server can generate
        the PKCE query and bind the session.

        -   Some discussion of PAR
        [<u>https://oauth.net/2/pushed-authorization-requests/</u>](https://oauth.net/2/pushed-authorization-requests/)
        Aaron asserts this would support this.

        -   Aaron notes the code implemented for assertion endpoint is
        basically FedCM check, is logged in, then does the same
        calls the authorization endpoints call.

        -   PKCE code extracted from nonce parameter, but an issue open
        –
        [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/556</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/556)
        – could resolve that

        -   **This is calling existing oauth endpoints - -if we get the
        issue resolved we could define my oauth authorization
        endpoint as my FedCM assertion endpoint with minimal
        changes**

    -   Ben: would it be beneficial to get access to cookies, after the
    access, sending a request to the IdP? Aaron: I would not need
    cookie access for the typical OAuth/IndieAuth use cases, only
    for silent refresh flows in OIDC that use prompt=none

    -   Ben: I have a proposal for the server end-points. The key point
    is how to make IdP registration.

        -   [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential)

    -   Brian: there’s definitely layering … confusion? … about
    parameters being produced. Tim suggested OAuth and OIDC
    profiles for FedCM. This looks like a backport of OAuth things
    into open spaces. How do we anticipate progressing with this
    kind of stuff. Work in defining a profile that would be
    interoperable….

        -   Aaron disagrees – FedCM doesn’t describe the token. In order
        to be interoperable it needs to be defined. Leaving it
        open allows different protocols to define different
        profiles.

        -   Tokens - eg google – returns a JWT identity

        -   Sam Goto to Everyone (May 21, 2024, 11:38)
        [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/585</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/585) -
        if this goes through, it simplifies the response to a JSON
        object.

        -   Where will the interpretation get defined?

        -   Aaron: ensure FedCM steps out of the protocol layer. Leave
        it to OAuth, OIDC, IndieAuth, Open Banking….

            -   OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Request (*RAR*)

        -   Issues filed are so that FedCM can step out of the way of
        the other protocols, standards

        -   Sam Goto to Everyone (May 21, 2024, 11:40) Aaron goes: "I
        don't think this is a big change to FedCM". Can confirm:
        not a big deal, as far as we are concerned.
        https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/578 We are on it,
        we can prototype some of this and report back momentarily.

            -   Brian: I (perhaps mistakenly) perceived some pushback in
            https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/579

    -   Elf: thank you for the demo, do you have the IdP for support
    specific profiles and how do you make this explicit?

        -   Aaron: the profile does have the “type” provider, the string
        or URI could be defined by profile/community. Then the RP,
        knowing the string it filters on, would know the
        profile/standard that is intended.

        -   If the IdP supports multiple, how does the RP indicate which
        profile?

            -   Aaron thinking about it

    -   Ben this is very similar to what he is thinking about in the
    other lightweight implementation. Seconds the idea that the
    token being called token is arbitrary; changing that will
    completely make sense. Change API so the escape pattern can be
    headed off.

    -   Many thanks to Aaron!!
