        -   Plan now exists:

        -   [<u>How should we manage proposals in
        github?</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FQccf3A2w4EuB5e4Z12oRsJEZvDo4hbzm_Td3yvNg8/edit#heading=h.mhvdl6a6fq9x)

        -   A lot of work by [<u>Sam Goto</u>](mailto:goto@google.com) –
        added useful pictures

    -   Sam

        -   Encourage people to read it through and provide opinions

        -   Based a lot on how others operate their WGs

        -   If people have other precedents - feel free to provide them

        -   Also, early parts of the doc are a lot more polished than
        the later parts of the doc

    -   Nicolas

        -   Feedback on the ??? part

        -   Suggests “a monkey patch for … stage 2” – seems a bit
        worrisome

        -   When can we discuss this a bit more?

    -   Sam

        -   Perhaps another pass would be helpful

        -   Latest revision has changed - as a result of BenVS’s
        feedback

        -   Ben suggested changing text to be a “spec diff” rather than
        “monkey patch” as a term

        -   Can be actual patch or a full Spec PR

    -   Nicolas

        -   Spec to include features that are in Stage 2

        -   And have the CR be basically a branch of the spec taht
        removes features that are not mature enough for Stage 3

    -   Sam

        -   At some point we can discuss – but current proposal is to
        take current spec and turn it into first Working Draft

        -   If taht works, each individual feature would come as a Spec
        Diff

        -   As WG feels that each feature is mature enough it gets
        merged into the Working Draft

        -   Once we have a CR we might operate might be different than
        current (which is before we have a CR)

        -   So today we have to work towards a CR and so we are working
        on incrementally patching the Working Draft until we have
        a CR which could be a branch of the Working Draft at the
        appropriate time

    -   Wendy

        -   Wanted to set stage for the rest of the group on the goals
        of this project

        -   To make a meaningful workflow for the group in editing the
        documents

        -   And to signal to folks who are watching at what stage of
        consensus things are

        -   And how likely they are to be implemented and made part of
        teh final / consensus specification

        -   So, thinking about it from those perspective, as someone
        working on the spec can you understand where things are
        and at what stages of consensus they are?

        -   And can things be experimented on?

        -   Can things be figured out as implementor or user of the tech
        what has been agreed to

    -   Sam

        -   Agreed with all of that

        -   For Nicolas, the Working Draft represents what we would like
        to bring to the group as a Candidate Recommendation

        -   So Spec PRs will be incrementally merged into the Working
        Draft

        -   Also ok that WD is ok to be not perfect

        -   Once the WD is something that everyone agrees to, it can
        become a CR

        -   WWhat happens after we get to a CR it’s unsure about how the
        process works there

        -   Need to focus right now on how we get from WD to CR

    -   Nicolas

        -   Makes sense - but maybe not best approach

        -   Spec is behind what we’ve discussed in the calls

        -   So it might be harder to make the spec up-to-date

    -   Wendy

        -   Asking Nicolas what he’d recommend instead?

        -   Maybe discuss in Slack or the Doc?

    -   Nicolas

        -   Counter-proposal is to have a Working Draft that contains
        features that are more experimental (Stage 2 or whatever)

        -   And have the CR only contain the features that are more
        evolved (Stage 3 or thereabouts)

        -   And so we can have those newer features in the WD spec but
        would have to branch off CR at various different points

    -   Sam

        -   How is what you proposed different?

        -   In Stage 2 we have a Working Draft that gets merged

        -   By the time we get to Stage 3 all the specs prs are merged

        -   Each individual proposal generates a diff and they all get
        merged

        -   And then from Stage 2 to Stage 3 it is a snapshot

    -   Nicolas

        -   In the text it’s not clear where things get merged

        -   So either update the doc

        -   Proposal says that once we reach CR we merge

    -   Sam

        -   But things get merged in Stage 2 (spec diffs get
        successively merged)

    -   Heather

        -   It needs clarification in terms of when Spec Diffs get
        merged and then when we have a CR

    -   Nicolas

        -   If that’s the case then that’s fine, but text needs to be
        updated

        -   And about CR we might have to make a branch for CR and that
        would necessarily remove any features that are not mature
        enough

        -   If that’s the proposal then that’s fine

        -   But need to clarify what the bar to merging to the spec is

        -   Don’t need to mandate that a spec has full consensus before
        being able to merge to the spec (which is what the text
        seems to specify currently)

        -   Would like to lower that bar for merging

    -   Ben

        -   If you want the spec to become a CR it should have consensus

    -   Nicolas

        -   Sole goal of Working DRaft is not just to be something that
        is fully agreed-upon

        -   It should also reflect features that are still being worked
        on

        -   If we waited for full consensus before merging to spec, then
        it will need a lot more work

    -   Ben

        -   If features were PRs to the spec, then discussions can
        happen there in the PR

        -   And it is possible to view all the PRs that are in-progress
        and the discussions there

    -   Sam

        -   Working draft does not need to represent consensus

        -   Can contain things that we don’t all agree with

        -   Has to make the WG bar, but can contain things we are still
        working on

        -   Doesn’t have to be perfect, but we’ve chosen as a group to
        work on it

        -   But the WD should represent things that, as a group, we have
        decided to eventually bring to CR

    -   Heather

        -   That should be a lot easier to discuss in-context would be
        easier with more examples

        -   Clarifying the text in the doc would be a lot helpful

        -   Documentation on how we are planning on proceeding with
        GitHub - if it doesn’t end up working we have the purview
        to change the process and doc describing it

        -   AI(Sam?): Clarify the WD / Spec PR merging / CR transition
        process and allowing of not-quite-consensus issues

-   Blog Post (to be clear of FedCM’s capabilities)

    -   Heather

        -   Especially with navigation-based tracking / having more than
        one IdP / etc.

        -   First draft now available

        -   [<u>DRAFT - The FedCM
        API</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16FuJFh-pC3VwIeu2phdux0F64gASVLWPA4YN4cQHIpE/edit#heading=h.czhu0jcajpvr)

        -   Would like to get this posted in the next 2 weeks or so

        -   So, review it and leave comments on anything that isn’t
        clear, etc.

        -   Thanks to Sam and Brian and others who have reviewed it /
        contributed to it so far (!)

-   WG Issues

    -   Heather

        -   There are several issues now in GitHub

        -   They are identified as issues identified that have to be
        resolved before CR

        -   But don’t need to be resolved to have a first WD

        -   Big agenda item for WG meeting that will be held before
        EOMonth

        -   Q: for Chrome: Chrome-CR-Blocking label

            -   Currently empty

    -   Sam

        -   I created that label

        -   Haven’t gotten around to apply it to specific issues

    -   Hetaher

        -   Also there is a Chrome label

    -   Sam

        -   Might have created that label, and then maybe noticed that
        everyone was just using “Mozilla” “Okta” etc. label

        -   So maybe the “chrome” label is the actual one and the
        “Chrome-CR-Blocking” label is superfluous / no longer used

    -   Heather

        -   If you want to have a specific issue tagged just let Heather
        know and she will tag it on your behalf

        -   Tagging it won’t block the first WD - but will help to focus
        attention on specific issues that people consider higher
        priority.

    -   Judith

        -   Is it the WG that should be labeling things as blockers? Or
        can CG do that?

    -   Heather

        -   CG members can add labels to issues

    -   Sam

        -   In terms of labels, if you could be more granular than just
        “CG” - perhaps “SAML” or “Shibboleth” would be better
        level of granularity

-   Issue \#319 - Allow multiple IdPs to be used.

    -   Nicolas

        -   Update: We have been working on improving the UI to make it
        good enough for Chrome Origin Trial

        -   Feature that is still experimental

        -   Developers can try it and start showing multiple users by

        -   End of August is planned initial Origin Trial

        -   Have some initial IdPs and RPs who are willing to start
        trying it

    -   Phil

        -   A bit confused

        -   Trying to put a few more things together for demo tomorrow

        -   Interaction of Multi-IdP and Login Status API and Login
        Windwo is confusing

        -   Visit Rp

        -   Haven’t logged into IdP

        -   FedCM won’t show me that IdP because IdP hasn’t had chance
        to set Login Status

        -   But if I want to use it

        -   Initiates pop-up window

        -   But can’t get to stage where it shows that IdP

        -   But FedCM seems to support model where you could go to RP
        and log in using IdP that you haven’t logged into the IdP

        -   Can’t seem to be able to do that without first going to IdP

    -   Nicolas

        -   Can see how that is potentially confusing

        -   We have Login Status - Signed IN / Signed Out / Unknown for
        initial time

        -   So if you visit RP then if Login Status is Signed In we will
        fetch accounts

        -   If it is Signed Out we don’t fetch

        -   If status is Uknown, we fetch accounts

        -   But if no accounts are returned don’t show UI

        -   Because we allow one-time setup cost to learn about IdP’s
        accounts and not have the user spammed about the fact that
        they are not logged into that IdP

        -   Ideally to show the Sign-In button but product decision to
        not show that

        -   But you could use the Button Mode to allow users to sign
        into the IdP

        -   Button Mode will always show a Sign-In dialog even if the
        user is Signed Out of the IdP

        -   But currently Button Mode doesn’t work with Multi-Idp but
        will in the future

    -   Phil

        -   If you sign out of an IdP and then go to an RP - will have
        to try that out

    -   Ben

        -   Obligatory plug for Lightweight FedCM

        -   …

        -   Also does support similar to Button Mode where, if you
        haven’t visited the site before you have to go to IdP via
        the Button and that will provide a pop-up to

    -   Judith

        -   Button mode for previous - that would allow buttons for
        multiple IdPs

    -   Nicolas

        -   Yes you can have separate buttons one for each IdPs

    -   Judith

        -   For more complex world - R&E - each intermediary int he
        model is an IdP in its own right

        -   So each IdP in the middle also has to make all the FedCM
        (endpoint, etc.) changes to make it work

        -   Intermediaries act as an RP on one side and IdP on the other

        -   And then user will have to start interacting with those
        intermediary IdPs as well

    -   Heather

        -   I think there was a video demo in the issues?

    -   Judith

        -   Collected 3 different videos of different redirect flows

        -   And other partners are collecting other videos to illustrate
        other use-cases for chained authentication

    -   Heather

        -   Ben noted the Lightweight FedCM as something to consider

        -   Also you could just pester the user with lots of “are you ok
        with this step, and then this step, etc?

    -   Judith

        -   Prdeesumably notify each step to the user so they can
        provide consent at each stage

        -   But then it provides mroe complex UI

    -   Phil

        -   Is Lightweight FedCM testable?

    -   Ben

        -   By end of month it should be available in Nightly Firefox
        builds

        -   Also comment to Judith

        -   In context where you have need to introduce each of several
        IdPs

        -   That’s the context where - weather or not you can get 3P
        cookie access or get a token from the very end endpoint

        -   What you can do is always window.open() - open the page of
        the thing you want to show to get the user’s consent

        -   Those are things the browser should not be doing – the IdP
        should have control over that interaction

    -   Judith

        -   Is there a way to send those initial request tokens on those
        Window-open hops

        -   Presumably the same issue of RP sending its request token up
        the chain

    -   Ben

        -   It would have to be on that initial step as well

    -   Phil

        -   Way this works is a bit different on how it works between RP
        and IdP

        -   If you go to IdP then IdP has to set :Login STatus

        -   Anything you do in a pop-up window, then it happens as it
        would in full-page redirect

        -   So you have to do special things for the first IdP but not
        for subsequent IdPs who all do their operations in the
        pop-up window

        -   So, unclear if intermediaries all have to be
        FedCM-compatible

    -   Ben

        -   In conception of FedCM - the ones that are intelligible to
        the user are the ones that should be FedCM-ready

        -   In lightweight - you can do bounces and annotations within
        the URL you provide there, so it has the characteristic
        where the user can consent and then bounce and then
        consent and bounce and then the end (?) would be the FedCM
        compatible one

        -   But it is very complication

    -   Phil

        -   Is it just replacing top-level redirects with redirects in a
        pop-up window?

        -   Seems like it needs deeper thought - through

-   Next Call

    -   Heather

        -   Call next week as planned

        -   Jul 23rd meeting will likely be canceled as Heather and
        others will be at IETF meeting

        -   Week after that (Jul 29th 30th)

            -   Monday evening Pacific call

            -   Tuesday will be WG call
