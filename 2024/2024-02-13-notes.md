    -   (sharing whiteboard) - see [COSAC.pdf](https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/blob/main/2024/COSAC.pdf)

    -   Wanted to describe problem and solution and then discuss

    -   Problem: FedCM does a lot more than the minimal required to
  enable Fed login

    -   Offers a sense of identity tied into the browser level

    -   Requires a bunch of extra works

    -   Custom service APIs

    -   Browser APIs

    -   Well known files

    -   Site-controlled UI in Browser UI

    -   Compared to the bare level that was historically in place a lot
  of new things is required

    -   Question: What is the minimum for a “Credential” and then step
  out of the way

    -   Let federated login work as it has but

    -   Credential is a JS object with associated data

    -   Can be created / stored in browser’s store / can be collected in
  browser’s credential store

    -   Can be queried

    -   In case of WebAuthn it could be USB key

    -   In the case of FedID it gets returned from IdP

    -   Can be bound to particular origin for use

    -   Question of what the minimal credential is to solve this and we
  have a definition of what minimal Credential is

    -   Cross origin Storage Access Credential (strawman solution)

    -   Use cross-origin credentials for the IdP

    -   Credential is bound to IDP RP pair

    -   Some method to get access to your Credential

    -   If you have it you can store it

    -   If you have it you can get it back

    -   Only happens via discovery

    -   Last bit is same model as FedCM where you get it from external
  place

    -   Needs to be able to opt in per-RP — security constraint in
  Storage Access world

    -   If you haven’t logged into IDP might have to do a redirect flow
  first

    -   Then might need to show UI to break down the privacy barrier

    -   Controversial part is how you actually do discovery

    -   Can only be single-IDP

    -   If you are collecting from credential store use as many IdPs as
  you want

    -   Will redirect to the current page

    -   Once you have a login page, you can see which IdP was trying to
  store the credential

    -   ONce you are back to the RP you can login with the Credential

    -   Real magic is that we can store them and put passwords into the
  Credential Manager

    -   This allows privacy barrier to be broken down between those two
  things

-   George

    -   Trying to understand

    -   Difference between getting a credential from IDP is single IDP
  vs. discovery is single IDP

    -   In many communities, there could be many many iDPs

    -   Does discovery mean that when you go to a credential store, you
  can only ask about one IDP at a time?

-   Ben

    -   Discovery means: You can request cross-site cookies from a.com,
  b.com. C.com d.com

    -   And you could redirect to b.com

-   George

    -   RP code already knows where the user wants to go

    -   And this is the mechanism to actually log in

    -   NASCAR screen logins have already happened

-   Ben

    -   Yes — could also have a call to “test existing”

    -   Could miss some with this

    -   But don’t force the user to go through the NASCAR page more than
  once

-   Matthew

    -   There is only a single IDP RP pair here?

    -   What if there is a single IDP in the flow

    -   But in reality there are multiple IDPs chained together?

    -   Not just logging into this IDP

    -   But that IDP chains to protocol translator that gets you to
  actual IDP

    -   Examples of that happen today and it is cross origin

    -   Protocol translator could be different domain than IDP

-   Ben

    -   Who needs access to 1st party cookies on the RP among those
  origins?

-   Matthew

    -   Not sure how to answer

-   Ben

    -   On RP and bounce through domain a to login page b and that
  navigates through c on way to RP

-   Matthew

    -   No it goes from RP to protocol translator but user won’t see
  that because it is fast, then they will do their IDP and do
  their login

    -   Then back to protocol translator

    -   Then back to RP

    -   All potentially cross-origin

-   George

    -   That is classic OpenID to SAML where OIDC is not doing actual
  authentication just there to serve authorization codes

    -   In that case no actual user end state at OIDC

    -   Will go out from OIDC to actual IDP which could in turn go
  through more chains

    -   If first entity is considered the first element of IDP RP pair

    -   The UI it could say “try to login to RP at foo.com” that
  wouldn’t make sense because foo.com isn’t the actual IDP

-   Matthew

    -   It’s more complicated than that

    -   Intermediary could maintain auth state as much as the IDP in
  this case

    -   End users aren’t going to know about intermediary

    -   They think they’ve clicked on their campus / Orchid / something
  and they won't know about intermediaries that are in play —
  could be more than one

-   BGeorge

    -   If it was OpenID provider it would have to maintain state

    -   Question Ben was asking is which does IDP need access to

    -   Is the intermediary the thing that needs to set the 3P cookie?

    -   Also pure UX question: How would the browser know what the IDP
  is behind “a” to generate correct UX?

-   Ben

    -   You’ve captured questions correctly

-   Phil

    -   In Matthew’s scenario it seems all cookies would be 1st party

    -   Except Logout

    -   Which would be iFramed

    -   Would be good to have a technique to allow that

-   Johann

    -   Maybe take high level

    -   Intermediary problem is interesting for everyone

    -   Heard that a bunch of times

    -   Leads to point on Ben’s proposal

    -   Great way forward

    -   Great way to simplify things

    -   Would prefer not to split ecosystem / web APIs into Storage
  Access vs FedCM vs another solution

    -   Would like all of that to be able to reconcile this with FedCM

    -   Would potentially allow solutions to intermediaries with FedCM

    -   Common base could be FedCM here

    -   High level point is to think about what this could look like if
  it was integrated into FedCM

-   Ben

    -   Could be useful to distinguish between providing identity
  services in the browser vs. just providing credentials

    -   Storage Access in the proposal is key

    -   By bringing Identity into the platform it makes it much more
  difficult

    -   That’s where a lot of the complexity of FedCM leads to

    -   It would be just “use your account from IDP.com”

-   Johann

    -   Sounds like a good idea

    -   Makes it easier to deploy for people

    -   Would be useful to have it integrated into FedCM

    -   Maybe have a base browser UI be very basic

    -   Login with idp.com

    -   Then it could display account info as an extension of the basic
  system

-   Nicolas

    -   Similar comment — ideas are interesting

    -   UI being so simple and generic may lead — if you think of SAA it
  is super-scary — whereas IDP.com is more friendly

    -   Worry that such UI might prompt people to use it for non-login
  cases

    -   Would it encourage trackers to use this UI because it entices
  users to log in thinking they won’t be tracked

    -   Whereas in the proposal you would get 3P cookies as soon as the
  user consents

-   VBen

    -   Yes — certainly a friendlier API than SAA UI

    -   But it does announce its purpose which is about login

    -   Which seems like direction SAA wants to go (Targeted UI)

    -   As soon as you offer any kind of privacy breakdown at all they
  can shuffle tokens around as they desire and track forever

    -   So same general critique exists for FedCM

-   Sam

    -   Trying to solve problems that we struggled with ourselves too

    -   Great to see explorations into other options

    -   Problems that are worked on here actually exist

    -   Questions about what the problems are too though

    -   No good picture of the UI being proposed here

    -   That would anchor a lot of things

    -   If there are no accounts in the UI, that leads to a bunch of
  properties

    -   Second question

    -   Other thing we haven’t formalized yet but we’ve been thinking
  about

        -   Not sure that once you pass a high-entropy token to the RP
      whether that is equivalent to full tracking

    -   Distinction we’re trying to find is to make a separation between
  case where RP is colluding with IDP vs not colluding with IDP

    -   Want to enable situation where RP can choose to not collude with
  IDP and still have federation and not have their users tracked
  by IDP

    -   If IDP is colluding with RP then IDP can track across all
  page-loads

    -   Want to try to find construction where RP can choose to not have
  their users be tracked by IDP

    -   Based on UX — why do you need to store credentials to construct
  the UX?

-   Ben

    -   “Bar.com” would need to be stored

-   Sam

    -   For bar.com, you would know you are logged in

    -   Foo.com, you are not already logged in

-   Ben

    -   This is the only prompt you get

-   Sam

    -   How do you get from linked to not-linked?

    -   By default, you get the one on the bottom (not linked)

-   Ben

    -   Yes

    -   But once you successfully do the redirect flow, you go to the
  top one

-   Sam

    -   Is that just a UX treatment or a threat model difference?

-   Ben

    -   Threat model difference

    -   That is the UI that breaks the privacy barrier

    -   User clicks to do a login

    -   Once the that login is successful the privacy barrier has been
  breached

-   Phil

    -   Go back to logout problem

    -   Could you do that the other way around?

-   Ben

    -   What is logout operation?

-   Phil

    -   Logged into 2 SPs

    -   Go to IDP

    -   Will pop up two iframes one for each SP or RPs

    -   And will use 3P cookies to do logs on all SPs

-   -   Session cookie for RP is required, so you’d need some sort of
  consent to enable that 3P cookie access

-   Ben

    -   In order to do that the logout screen would be on intermediary

    -   Could make the power of this thing symmetric or optionally
  symmetric

    -   That \*should\* support that

    -   RP would have to say “I’m ok to share cookies with them if they
  need to do that”

    -   Allows RP to maintain control over cookies in 3P contexts

-   Achim

    -   Like point about onramp approach and upgradability

    -   IDP perspective doesn’t want to implement 3 different apis

    -   But want option of implementing just onramp approach that works
  everywhere but fits in seamlessly with others

    -   Also the intermediary problem always boils down to different
  threat and security issues

    -   Browser operates on site origin basis

    -   But trust model for intermediaries allows info to pass through
  intermediaries

    -   But that conflicts with browser security and privacy concerns

    -   Intermediaries always look like bounce trackers

    -   And thinking of multiple domains SAA doesn’t work anymore

    -   It’s kind of like “spreading out”

    -   We didn’t expect this problem to be solved quickly

    -   We don’t have 1000s of IDPs — that’s where Multi-IODP off FedDCM
  plays well

    -   Consider some sort of federation or intermediary thing

    -   Need access to cookies because they contain authentication state

    -   Each of those are critical from browser security model

    -   Do we always need to expect that all of these intermediary
  parties need to pop up in a UI. even though most users are not
  even aware of intermediaries?

    -   Or can we have constructs that can wrap these entities in a more
  lightweight framing?

-   Ben

    -   Quickly say — yeah, it’s hard, because as a browser, don't want
  to allow random 3rd party to get access to unpartitioned
  cookies in someone else’s context

    -   Not sure how to draw that line

    -   All intermediaries look like bounce trackers

    -   If we know RP requests to IDP and it bounces thorough “to IDP”
  and IDP then completes the cycle

    -   We could “know” that the intermediary in that chain was actually
  an intermediary

    -   There is actually structure in that redirect chain that we could
  observe

    -   And user action in the final IDP is the observable action to
  determine that that is a legitimate redirect flow

-   Johann

    -   So many great points made!

    -   Generally want to reiterate that unifying on a single web API
  story for developers is a good idea

    -   In practice, that means using existing FedCM and SAA APIs that
  we have

    -   No big compelling reason to create a new API surface so far

    -   Focusing on requirements in the doc

    -   Look into why we can or can’t provide solutions with existing
  APIs

    -   We have been looking at these ideas in Chrome; in particular,
  SAA mediated through fedCM

    -   As Sam mentioned, lots of challenges to make sure it doesn’t
  regress when trying to avoid IUDP tracking when RP and IDP
  don’t collude

    -   Looking to propose “something” like this

    -   Would like to look at this in more detail and follow up with
  individual proposals

-   Yi

    -   Little confused at the beginning

    -   Mentioned that there is a list of RPs that IDP can be exposed
  to?

-   Ben

    -   That’s one point I breezed over

    -   Reiterate

    -   Discovery is single IDP

    -   As soon as user clicks that it gives redirect flow

    -   To improve — allow IDP to pre-register — allow IDP to specify
  which RPs are accessible

    -   And maybe use CORS headers to enable access

-   Yi

    -   This UI doesn’t cover the improvement?

    -   That IDP would show up on the first row once they have done
  pre-registration then?

-   Ben

    -   That would be browser choice

-   Yi

    -   Seems similar to Bring your Own IDP that is being proposed in
  Chrome

    -   Part of the same Registration API

    -   Are you thinking, no UI in the IDP registration phase?

-   Ben

    -   Yeah — thinking no UI in IDP registration

-   Yiu

    -   So if IDP wants to register for 10,000 RPs

-   Ben

    -   IDP doesn’t give any name or email

    -   IDP just says I’m cool with these RPs

    -   There aren’t any account details

-   Yi

    -   If there are multiple accounts for that IDP there would then be
  multiple accounts?

-   Ben

    -   Yes — in that case there could be an account chooser, for
  example

    -   If it determines that , say it has 5 Google accounts, you would
  have your Google 3P cookies

    -   And Google account services would provide a new account chooser
  window

    -   But critically, that IDP UI is the IDP’s problem, not the
  browser’s problem

-   Yi

    -   What is the difference between this and the IDP registration
  API?

-   Ben

    -   Would have to look in more detail

-   Sam

    -   One difference I see is that there would be a user permission
  prompt for IDP registration

-   Ben

    -   The registration doesn’t store

    -   Just allows discovery to happen without interaction

    -   It is registration of IDP

    -   IDP gets registered on its own top-level page

    -   So user would have to login to the IDP on the IDP page and
  that’s when the IDP would register

    -   Only serves for security properties of the IDP

    -   Registration says that, for example, when you go to do your
  discovery flow, when you try to login, it doesn’t do a bounce
  — instead just gives the credential back to the page

-   Sam

    -   So by registration, you register the credential itself?

    -   Is it fair to say that both bar.com and foo.com have
  pre-registered?

-   Ben

    -   No — bar.com has pre-registered and foo.com has not
  pre-registered and has not completed a login flow on foo.com

-   Sam

    -   Is registration RP agnostic?

-   Ben

    -   Registration is what an IDP can do to simplify its linking flow

    -   Registering is what you do at the IDP

    -   Linking is logging in with Google on a given page

-   Johann

    -   Why would it show any UI if they have already consented to this?

-   Sam

    -   Linking is pair-wise

-   Ben

    -   What if a site wanted to provide choice of using WebAuthn token
  vs Federated Token

-   Johann

    -   Not as much for Multi-IDP but single IDP

    -   Try to log into foo.com

    -   Would it always do a redirect flow?

    -   Even if it is registered

-   Sam

    -   Is there a UI for not linked and not registered?

    -   Is there a UI for registered but not linked?

-   Ben

    -   Same

    -   Credential would be used to complete top-level authentication
  flow?

    -   How about for next time I’ll clear up UI and provide example for
  some of those cases

-   Heather

    -   Next call: 30 mins to continue this and then 30 mins for SAML
  breaking examples without 3P cookies
