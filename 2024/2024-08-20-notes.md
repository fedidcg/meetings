* CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential  
    * Heather  
      * After previous call where LWC (lightweight credentials) were demonstrated, people wanted a comparison table  
      * Ben created this table  
    * Ben  
      * [Comparison table](https://github.com/fedidcg/CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential/wiki/Comparing-FedCM-and-FedCM-%22Light%22)  
      * Two tables  
      * First gets into functionality comparisons  
      * Second goes into privacy implications  
      * Various asterisks to capture subtleties  
    * Johann  
      * Haven‘t seen it yet but looks interesting  
    * Sam  
      * Started looking at it  
      * Should we discuss it here?  Or file issues?  
    * Ben  
      * Issues are great. If there are any that are particularly critical, we can discuss here  
    * Heather  
      * If there are any items that are just not understood — best to discuss here  
    * Sam  
      * A couple are important  
      * Use of “tokens” comes to mind  
      * ARe there any IDPs that would be able to use tokens as described in the document?  
      * Or is “token” being used differently here?  
      * We’ve learned from IdPs that the thing that RPs get is something that is created specifically for each RP — not something that can be used across RPs  
    * Ben  
      * That is the first asterisk  
      * Token here just means data stored by the IdP  
      * Directed to the RP in regular FedCM (4th row specifically — tokens are RP-specific)  
      * Haven’t heard from any IdPs that this proposal is either broken or good  
      * Advantage is that you can still get your cookies here  
      * Trying to be descriptive rather than shape of proposals  
    * Sam  
      * If guessing, fact that it is RP-specific in pull model of FedCM is a feature not a bug  
    * Ben  
      * More of a difference in shape  
      * Not necessarily one better than the other  
    * Nicolas  
      * Different — so maybe not call it a “token”?  
    * Ben  
      * Token is more of a legacy name  
    * Sam  
      * Agree they are different  
      * Any concrete things from IdPs where they would actually use this form of token?  
      * What info would an IdP want to share with all IdPs?  
    * Ben  
      * Look at how Aaron did indie-auth in regular FedCM  
      * He doesn’t actually care which RP gets it  
      * More of a link to a different place  
      * Could put a link to another endpoint  
      * And fetch that using unpartitioned cookies  
    * Sam  
      * We did implement Aaron’s spec  
      * It does get a code, but that code \*is\* RP-specific  
      * Otherwise it would allow replay attacks  
      * RP could take it and have the user sign into other RPs if that code was not protected against replay attacks  
    * Ben  
      * In that case, it could be a link to an endpoint to get a directed token  
      * Not trying to define the identity protocol  
      * Just trying to provide an abstract player (?)  
      * How data can be exchanged between IdP and RP  
    * Sam  
      * Good clarification  
      * Maybe we should pick a different name as it has different properties and has different mechanism that what we understand as “tokens” today  
      * Also would need to define ways in which Identity protocols could use this mechanism  
      * If we put this in front of IdPs and there aren’t any concrete use-cases, we might not want to continue this?  
    * Ben  
      * Would want to discuss it more / socialize it with IdPs first to explore potential solutions  
    * Sam  
      * Share intuition that it is a new potential communications channel  
      * Not completely clear how it could be used  
      * But seems resolvable — we’ll learn as a community — as long as it doesn’t break any privacy & security boundaries, it should be fine  
      * Other item is looking at Privacy boundaries of pop-up window when user is logged out  
      * Chatted with Johann a bit about it  
      * Know that you (Ben) are aware of where we stand with that — haven’t managed how to go about that yet  
      * Intuition so far that we could start with not having the privacy relaxation and then cross that bridge when we get there — when we have an IdP that finds it hard for them to pull the .well-known file  
      * Seems like it would be easier to get the bit once we determine that it is the determining factor for adoption  
    * Ben  
      * (a bit confusing…)  
    * Sam	  
      * When chatting with Johann — table only shows the differences but doesn’t show commonalities  
      * If you look at proposal — 80% is non-controversial  
      * So proposal was to start from those items that are in common  
      * Remaining 20% is still important — items that will ultimately align but aren't yet are fine, but the relaxation of privacy boundaries in pop-up window is still an issue and we don’t see how to resolve that right now, so we’re punting on that for now  
    * Johann  
      * Useful to have a prototype that has the common bits  
      * But it would be very good to have an IdP that actually says “this is a good thing”  
    * Ben  
      * For that, there have been lots of discussions on multi-hop handling and dealing with .well-known files  
    * Johann  
      * Want to implement it in ways where it can only be used with a .well-known file  
      * Want to be quick and reactive to conversations  
      * But we want to preserve privacy boundary where we see it now and then proceed after conversations  
    * Sam  
      * This doesn’t seem to me to be the thing that is preventing adoption of FedCM by other IdPs  
      * Especially from design incentives perspective  
      * Not clear to me that this will re-align incentives such that this will tip the point where adoption will switch  
    * Johann  
      * Have discussions on the general complexity of uploading and maintaining server-side for JS API like this  
      * So, need to do some form of prototyping and experimentation before relaxing the privacy boundary  
    * Nicolas  
      * Already have a number of people who have complained about .well-known file being a pain for some developers  
      * Wondering if there could be an alternative privacy-preserving way of opening the browser UI  
    * Ben  
      * There was this as an earlier proposal  
      * But because you don’t have an account at that point you can’t get one with a generic request and you’d need a “log in with this IdP” mechanism  
      * So backed off from that avenue  
    * Sam  
      * What was the specific proposal?  
    * Ben  
      * Would show dialog before you do the navigation away  
      * But because no account stored in browser and no credentialed request, have to show a genericized prompt that would say “log into this IdP”  
      * So, argued against it  
    * Sam  
      * Remember arguing against some of that  
      * How would the browser learn about the login URL?  
    * Ben  
      * RP would provide it  
    * Sam  
      * Yes — in Chrome, if we were to keep the privacy bar, we could show IdP selector to maintain the privacy bar  
    * Nicolas  
      * Even with that, it’s technically a question  
      * Does showing the “do you want to sign in with this IdP?” potentially leak the RP?  
      * Depends on the UI  
      * Also alternative ways to handle this without imposing the need for a .well-known file  
    * Sam  
      * Anything come to mind, specifically  
      * Only remember a DNS option based system  
      * Everything else seems like it requires  
    * Heather  
      * Seems like this discussion should go into a discuss  
    * Johann  
      * Could someone own the task of writing up the various proposals?  
      * Maybe in time for TPAC?  
      * At least have all the various options either as an issue or a small readme  
    * Sam  
      * I can take a stab at writing down the proposals that occur to me and work with Nicolas and Ben on it?  
    * Johann  
      * That would be great  
      * Would be also good to have a table that laid out the pros and cons of each proposal  
    * Heather  
      * George asks: is there a clear path to where navigational tracking is going, from a privacy perspective?  
    * Ben  
      * Bounce tracking protection (FF is prototyping)  
      * Takes care of silent tracking  
      * More general issues dealing with navigation tracking in general (URL decoration, etc.) FF does not have a strong solution for that  
    * George  
      * Thanks  
      * We need to — if there’s a privacy principle we want to ensure is in the solution, we should make sure it is carried out by the layers that we are looking at  
      * Otherwise hard to protect privacy principles without going into the weeds  
      * Getting into Navigational tracking is a slippery slope  
    * Heather  
      * Many people on call want to know how FedCM will evolve to deal with Navigational tracking  
      * For now we just don’t want to preclude any particular direction, but not put that specifically in scope as it is a really hard problem  
      * Other issue from chat: Issues from Edu Identity where IdPs don’t want to share any login info unless they know who’s asking (RP identity)  
    * Brian  
      * Discussion has been centered on API level  
      * Stepping back this seems to be solving slightly different set of use-cases and presenting a different user journey  
      * A lot of account management being shifted into the browser  
      * Seems that that would be good to capture  
      * Where would user go to manage their accounts  
      * Where users go to manage interactions with websites is crucial  
      * Would be good to call that out to clarify different use-cases  
      * Edu use-cases are very different than Bring Your Own Identity use-cases  
    * Ben  
      * THanks for calling out  
      * Will try to add use-cases/user-journeys as a 3rd table  
      * See where it does bring browser into state management thing  
      * But part of this is to have the browser do less  
    * Heather  
      * Any other questions on this before people review on their own?  
    * Sam  
      * Not noted on table, but difference that Brian went over — push model issue on how to keep credentials fresh  
      * Heard from some IdPs that having the data fresh was very important (e.g., for legal reasons)  
      * Doing that might require some sort of Service Worker or similar mechanism  
    * Ben  
      * That’s kind of in the 5th row  
      * Store in browser with lifetime specified, as opposed to dynamic refresh  
    * Sam  
      * Is the thought then that once credentials are expired they would be re-fetched?  
    * Ben  
      * No, after expiry it would revert back to generic IdP UI / Sign Into IdP  
    * Sam  
      * So effectively logged out (from the browser’s perspective)?  
    * Ben  
      * I think there’s actually a different state there — between expired and logged out  
* FedCM  
    * Note repo migration — [https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM)  
      * Heather  
        * Not that the repo has now migrated to the WG area  
        * Old link will now redirect to new link  
    * FPWD published today — [https://www.w3.org/TR/fedcm/](https://www.w3.org/TR/fedcm/)  
      * Heather  
        * Woohoo\!\! 🙂  
        * May be other working drafts before we get to Candidate Recommendation  
        * Perfectly normal / desirable  
        * But this is a great step along the way\!  
      * Nicolas  
        * How often should we update the Working Draft?  
        * Who will track that?  
        * Editor’s draft gets updated right away  
        * Then you need to get a snapshot into Working Draft  
        * Is there a specific way that that happens?  
      * Weather  
        * It’s a WG decision  
        * We’ve got enough change where we decide to actually update  
      * Wendy  
        * It’ll be a question for discussion with the group about whether there are changes that are significant where we want a new reference point  
        * E.g., there’s a breaking change and we want people to refer to the new spec instead  
        * Trying to keep the version that appears in the W3C URL up to date via the Editor’s Draft for people to be able to see the Tip-of-Tree version of the group  
      * Heather  
        * That’s all in the description of how we’ll use GitHub  
      * Wendy  
        * Yes  
        * Just responding to Nicolas’ questions about how we’ll handle bigger changes  
      * Simone  
        * That’s correct, in general  
      * Heather  
        * Is guidance on the GitHub procedures in the repo?  
      * Wendy  
        * Pieces of it are there — more to come  
    * Passing arbitrary parameters to the ID assertion endpoint — [\#556](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/556)  
      * Christian  
        * Touched upon this a few weeks ago  
        * This was going to be discussed at the IETF meeting on OpenID  
      * Heather  
        * There ended up being a big announcement about not deprecating third-party cookies  
        * Derailed all other discussions  
        * So, this issue was never discussed  
      * Christian  
        * Came to potential conclusion  
        * Might just allow arbitrary objects as values  
        * Then serialize the entire key-value map as one parameter called, say, “params”  
        * Should address most people’s concerns  
        * If there are any objections, please comment in the issue  
        * Apart from that we feel it is a good resolution  
      * Heather  
        * Will ping Aaron (since he had been planning on talking about this at IETF)  
        * And make sure he puts in any other comments  
* AOB  
    * Ben  
      * On *FedCM Lite* front, Johann and I will discuss further to pick appropriate name  
    * Heather  
      * CG call is Pacific call next Monday evening  
      * WG is Tuesday
