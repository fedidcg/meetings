# Notes

Heather: Welcome, code of conduct reminders  
Simone: preparing documents for publication through the W3C toolchain.   
Wendy: no further comments, waiting feedback from Martin about the language change.  
Sam: we have this discussion from Chrome [https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/623\#discussion\_r1705698789](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/623\#discussion\_r1705698789)  
Wendy: We’ll send another call to the list to make sure everyone has a chance to review the full issue list before minting FPWD.

# 

Simone: charter review will go out soon. I have a [team report on identity](https://w3c.github.io/identity-web-impact/) seeking internal comment before publishing along with the proposed re-charter to AC review on the 13th and the threat model.

Ben VanderSloot: Demo\! This is unfinished; things are still subject to change. If you enable the pref in latest Firefox nightly, via about:config and credentialmanagement.identity.lightweight. You can also disable WebCompat to make sure everything works.

URL for demo:  
[https://lightweight-fedcm-provider.glitch.me/](https://lightweight-fedcm-provider.glitch.me/)

If you’re at an identity provider, creating a new registration.   
lightweight-fedcm-login.glitch.me. Sign in.   
Grabbed secret data stored with IDP in cookie. Magic is an invisible iframe. You don’t need a user action. You can also login silently, no-ui; that works if you’re already logged in. If logged out, it doesn’t work. If registered with 2 accounts, you get a chooser. 

Question: For the redirect, how does it communicate with the original JS?  
Ben: When you register a credential that would have been able to be collected, it shouldn’t show a prompt. It doesn’t force the redirect, but stores the credential and allows the redirect.  
\[Showing code on glitch\]  
Since you can’t really delete a credential, I’m storing one that’s effective nowhere.

Question: one-time use tokens are not expected to be stored long-term,   
Ben: Token is used for compatibility with FedCM. It’s just data. 

Phil: You can set an expiry for the token?  
Ben: That applies to UI hints

Aaron:  how does this solve the privacy concerns that FedCM solves with the eTLD+1 requirements and such …   
Ben: To make yourself an IDP, you declare where your credential is effective — what RPs it works for. In this demo, I just give a list of origins. You can also say effectiveQueryURL. If you request that URL and get an ACAO 200, then server-side control list of origins. Also can do effectiveType, e.g., IndieAuth.

Ben: How do we deal with navigational tracking problems? Open question of the lightweight FedCM spec is whether to handle it at all. I believe that handling it here is probably not the right choice. No worse from a privacy perspective than window.open call. 

Nicolas: Thanks for the cool demo. Clarifies lots of details about the API to me. Re: eTLD+1, FedCM needs to deal with issues because it does credentialed fetch. This API doesn’t do that but uses stored creds, right? There’s nothing you’ll learn from an RP trying to request lightweight FedCM. It doesn’t have that problem, but what about stale credentials? If the user signs out but the IDP doesn’t update, what happens? You can try to match the expiry of cookie and registration. 

Aaron: In the OAuth profile for FedCM, what gets passed through FedCM is a few-seconds long authorization code. In the lightweight FedCM version, because you’re storing something in the browser, it will need to work completely differently. Will look at the Firefox nightly. 

Nicolas: think you’d have to request stored access, pass the token via iframe.

Sam: Thank you so much for the demo. Love it. Solves timing attack problem, more performant, fewer HTTP endpoints for IDPs.  A few questions: Are you also planning to support a model of loading accounts via other means? 

Ben: Not necessarily mutually exclusive, but I’d have to look. 

Sam: Assuming this works well with multiple IDP API, IdP registration API. Is there any integration you feel would be awkward?

Ben: The “buttons” in the demo aren’t necessarily button flow.   
\[discussion of user interaction and notifications\]

Sam: Wrinkle in the case where the user is logged out and we need to get the user to log in. Also, re: navigational tracking — we’ve tried to keep FedCM resilient to navigational tracking changes.

Heather: Whether or not navigational tracking is in scope is a core difference. Want to see where there are others. Tim suggested a table that compares the two APIs and shows key differences. 

Ben: I think I could work on that

Heather: Perhaps Ben and Nicolas could work together

Tim: and include the privacy goals of each API, so we can understand if they are the same or how they differ 

From chat: “Tim: A table that contrasts FedCM and "FedCM Light", from a functionality, a privacy goals, and privacy implications standpoint, I think would be helpful at this point.”

Sam: Where is this proposal, maturity level and review? 

Ben: That table will be helpful for reviews as well

Heather: Maybe use the wiki space in the repository

Ben: I do have some improvements in the pipeline.  
Naming: Lightweight FedCM, FedCM Light, FedCM Zero. If anyone has comments, please share. [https://github.com/fedidcg/CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential/issues/32](https://github.com/fedidcg/CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential/issues/32) 

Tim: Many names: what developers would call it, what the spec calls it. 

Yi Gu: Where would the grant be revoked? 

Ben: Temporary grant, has the short lifetime of heuristics

Yi Gu: Not using FedCM as a signal. 

Ben: I’ll double-check. 60 seconds is for the hint, not the lifetime of the credential. For those looking to prototype with effectiveType features, there’s an open bug that will close when the feature lands.   
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1911634](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1911634) 

Heather: Thanks Ben\!

Tim: Probably add a feature detection method to this. I’ll raise an issue

Brian: Trying to understand longer-term implications for standardization. Are we looking to standardize two distinct APIs, trying to reconcile the two? 

Heather: Right now, Ben’s proposal is incubating in the CG, not yet proposed or accepted as a work item in the WG. We’re trying to figure out if they can be reconciled, or if not, what happens next. 

Sam: FWIW, I understand Ben trying to propose something that can be reconciled, not two distinct. I worry more about the intersection with the digital credentials proposal. 

AOB

Ben: I wanted to call attention to a breakout session proposal for TPAC, [https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-breakouts/issues/20](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-breakouts/issues/20)	  
Please join if you’re attending TPAC.
