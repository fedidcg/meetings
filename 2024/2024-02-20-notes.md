Notes
=====

-   Topic 1: Simplifying FedCM — whiteboarding session (continued)

    -   Ben
    -   Today's [whiteboard](COSAC-2.pdf) (PDF)

        -   Where we last left off — straw-man solution

        -   Credential can be stored in credential store

        -   Semantics allow you to get top-level storage access

        -   Have a button to link to given IDP, open pop-up to redirect
          flow (or just log you in, as appropriate) and then
          credentials can be collected from store

        -   Code examples discussion (from shared doc)

        -   “IDP on Auth redirect or login”

            -   Look for cross-site requests

            -   Make sure that it’s an RP that you can share your
              cookies onto

            -   Allows IDP to validate RPs to send cookies onto

            -   Would not replace CORS

            -   Ideally pre-register to indicate which origins you want
              to allow

            -   If it gives a 200 from CORS, it will be allowed

            -   Turning CORS endpoint into allowed origin

        -   “RP code”

            -   3 different flows

            -   First: Mediate silent

            -   Does not allow redirect

            -   Would not change top-level navigation

            -   Would list as many providers as desired

            -   Used when already logged in

            -   Second: login button

            -   E.g., log in with idp.net

            -   Could use mediation

            -   But also have allow-redirect: true

            -   Could enable bounce use-case

            -   Identity the specific IDP and the bounce use-case

            -   Third: On login link

            -   mediation: conditional (allows silent)

            -   RP using credential

            -   Use SAA to get the credential

        -   4 states

            -   Either logged in / logged out but linked / maybe logged
              in but not linked / brand new completely

        -   UI is non-normative credential chooser (doesn’t exist in
          browser, but everyone seems to want)

        -   Choices: log back in on your rp.com account or link account
          to accounts.foo.com

        -   If you haven’t yet linked, you get linked choice

        -   Clicking A) yields no navigation

        -   Clicking B) will do navigation if appropriate

    -   George

        -   To clarify — if the top UI gets replaced with (A), how will
          they know which account they will be logged in with?

    -   Be

        -   It won’t — bar.com will have access to its cookies

    -   George

        -   Like 2 steps

        -   Allow SAA

        -   Here are the 5 email addresses logged into the email
          provider; which one do you want?

    -   Ben

        -   Yes

        -   But at (A) dialog, you’ve already linked with

        -   Maybe bar.com can remember which one you already linked with

    -   George

        -   E.g., if you have multiple email accounts, etc.

        -   They will already be linked

        -   If you load mail.yahoo.com, you’d get dialog A

        -   But then yahoo.com would need to do something to choose the
          specific account

    -   Ben

        -   Is this SSO or logging in using a specific account?

    -   George

        -   Both

        -   If you went to mail.yahoo.com…

    -   Ben

        -   You’d still be on the same site, so you’d have access to
          those cookies

    -   George

        -   Still interesting aspect of, if multiple accounts connected
          from same IdP to RP,

        -   Then logging back in using bar.com could represent 2 or 3
          linked accounts

        -   Then the RP would have to do some disambiguation to
          determine the desired account

    -   Ben

        -   Reasonable to require RP to do that disambiguation in the
          interest of browser stepping out of the way

        -   But also possible to have browser add optional “here are the
          potential accounts”

        -   Then that would have the account chooser for the accounts
          appropriate for bar.com

    -   BNicolas

        -   What’s the meaningful difference between proposal and
          literally adding param to rSA that has purpose for login?

        -   Seems like kind-of the same

        -   Need extra JS methods that are not gated by user

        -   Only prompt is the link-your-accounts

        -   Once you click that, you grant rSA to the IDP

        -   What’s the difference in practical terms between that and
          having

    -   Ben

        -   This would give SAA in top-level

        -   And there is some degree of opt-in from IdP for security
          purposes

        -   Current Storage Access only affects one document in
          cross-site

        -   In a fetch cross-site, current SAA will not allow that

        -   Several proposals to allow that, but none of them are
          actually doing it?

    -   Nicolas

        -   Will the top level actually fetch accounts?

        -   Or why does the top level need the cookies?

    -   Ben

        -   If IDP has iframe, this current SAA requires interaction
          with iframe to get SAA

    -   Nicolas

        -   But this is a simpler prompt that allows more powerful
          access?

    -   Ben

        -   Yes, but it is more purposefully — login / logout specific

    -   Nicolas

        -   Helps

    -   Yi

        -   No UI on IDP side

        -   So user navigates to IDP and logs in

        -   Then IDPs can register RPs to the browser

        -   Are we confident the user has confidence to allow the link?

    -   Ben

        -   Seems clearer on the RP side to have that dialog than IDP
          side

        -   All being generated statically from credential fetch

        -   So no privacy

    -   Yi

        -   And fetch will go with cookies

    -   Ben

        -   Once you click "link account", it will use existing or
          navigate to IDP

        -   Inside providers list

        -   Auth-origin is high entropy

        -   But neither is used to generate dialog

        -   Only when you click link does it generate

    -   Yi

        -   No fetch until button click

        -   And no correlation between click

        -   So no timing attack concerns with this formulation

    -   Ben

        -   Sidesteps a lot of complication, by forcing a dialog before
          doing any requests at all

    -   Phil

        -   Q: IDP needs to register all the RPs that are allowed to
          make this linkage?

    -   Ben

        -   That would be done in one of 3 ways

        -   Either when in redirect flow, you can look at pending
          requests, do computation on requests, and allow it

        -   Or on login on IdP, say “hey, any future requests, here’s a
          list of origins that correspond to this”

        -   Or here’s an endpoint that will give you an ACAO CORS
          response to RP allowability

        -   So you could have dynamic list or static list

    -   Phil

        -   So initial login is handled by top-level redirect

    -   Ben

        -   Initial login to IdP could not be even part of an RP flow

        -   Then you may never have to redirect

        -   User clicks link, and then hits endpoint and gets credential

        -   Or if in redirect flow, user allows it and credential gets
          stored in credential store

        -   And then in the future, then do mediation that isn’t silent,
          will look in the list for, e.g., yahoo, and will throw
          that into the account chooser dialog

        -   If this is the only one you want it will either have it or
          reject

    -   Phil

        -   If a redirect to IDP involves more than one redirect and
          goes to a 3rd party, does it matter?

    -   Ben

        -   That’s handled by whoever wants the 3P cookies you make the
          auth origin

        -   Then for the redirect, you throw in the auth origin, and it
          will hit that during bounce-back

        -   Bounce-tracking mitigations might need some mitigations to
          prevent that from getting cleared in bounce tracking
          mitigation

        -   Maybe set some bit to indicate to bounce tracking system to
          not clear any of the info until that bit is unset

    -   Achim

        -   That means that the assumption is that the user must have
          visited the IdP before this works?

    -   Ben

        -   No

        -   If haven’t visited IdP before, you’ll have to call the API
          as the RP with only one provider

        -   could be on NASCAR button

        -   Click login with IdP

        -   Among options will be "link with idp.net"

        -   That will navigate the user away

        -   Runs IdP on auth redirect or login snippet

        -   That will then store credential in browser credential store

        -   Trying to preserve some IdP control over it and security of
          origin boundary

    -   Heather

        -   Next steps?

        -   Feedback? Ticket? Issue?

    -   Ben

        -   Gets to the FedCM relation

        -   Notes in the doc on that

        -   Chrome were adamant they did not want to expand API space

        -   But this is a different case and seems reasonable

        -   Similar to rSAFor proposals

        -   Where to hang this is a question up in the air

        -   Can provide Explainer and Draft Spec

    -   Heather

        -   Seems like an additional work item

        -   If the decision in the future is to merge them, that can be
          done, but for now separate?

    -   Johann

        -   Yes, for now would have to be a different item with its own
          explainer

        -   Have a few more questions

        -   Will need to need more full writeup and explore that in more
          detail

        -   Point to not complicate API space too much is also def a
          goal

        -   All the goals — flexibility trying to achieve — is all very
          valid and justified

        -   Address the potential question of “should I implement FedCM
          or this competing thing?”

    -   Heather

        -   Agree with long-term goal but incubation

        -   I’ll update Charter work item area to include / add this

-   Topic 2: SAML

    -   [<u>https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues/122</u>](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues/122)

    -   SAML protocol not impacted by 3P Cookie Deprecation, but broader
      SAML systems still rely on 3P cookies and will be impacted by
      3PCD

    -   Heather

        -   Switching gears

        -   Had been an issue submitted in Privacy Sandbox around SAML
          support

        -   Where does the SAML world find things falling down with
          3PCD?

        -   SAML protocol is as stable as stable can be (SAML group has
          disbanded0

        -   Research community folks have been discussing what to show
          in terms of breakage

        -   SAML has huge concerns on navigation based tracking
          mitigations

        -   But for now it’s the other (3P cookie) items

    -   Phil

        -   Tried to discuss SAML issues last week

        -   No direct issue with 3P cookie deprecations

        -   Single logout is affected

        -   Wondering if Ben’s new proposal could be switched around to
          address that concern

        -   Wanted to explain more complicated SAML environments we have

        -   Haven’t done that yet but still planned

        -   Wanted to explore it to see what kinds of things might break

        -   Simple demo of Authentication Intermediary Flow

        -   Doesn’t have a use-case with FedCM but will demonstrate what
          that might look like wrt FedCM

        -   &lt;showing demo recording&gt;

        -   Example of proxy flow

        -   Have FedCM speaking to proxy

        -   Proxy talks to upstream IdP

        -   Proxy will supply RP with token

        -   Proxy itself is signed in using sign-in status API

        -   Proxy doesn’t actually handle sessions

        -   Upstream provider is not signed in

        -   FedCM will pop-up

        -   No accounts returned

        -   Proxy comes up in pop-up box

        -   So that will contact upstream provider

        -   User will click “continue”

        -   Upstream provider will say “you haven’t signed into
          upstream”

        -   User will sign in

        -   Then proxy can retrieve accounts from upstream

        -   Then that will return token

        -   Then RP can contact proxy to get the token

        -   Token comes back in response

        -   All a bit of a hack because next time you use FedCM, FedCM
          thinks you are logged into proxy

        -   But proxy doesn’t store state

        -   FedCM cannot do redirects in the direct flow (but can in the
          pop-up)

        -   But in this case, proxy won’t have token, and therefore
          won’t return anything to FedCM

        -   Technically, the pop-up from FedCM could be a redirect to
          IdP (user has already logged into IdP)

        -   IdP will return token to proxy, and then that will return
          token to FedCM, which will return token to RP

        -   Technically proxy could say it is logged into browser, but
          it won’t have any accounts, so, because FedCM doesn’t
          handle redirects in the basic flows, it won’t get the
          tokens

        -   In these cases, there will be chains and each intermediary
          will want to access its 1st party cookies

        -   So, that would work outside of FedCM, but in FedCM it may
          not have those cookies and so wouldn’t work

        -   Next week we might show front-channel logout

    -   Yi

        -   Thanks — understand much better

        -   Comments: Use button flow

        -   Still in development

        -   There might end up with different UI

        -   In the demo, there wasn’t a Permissions dialog Privacy
          Policy / Terms of Service

        -   It is still in development

        -   If the prompt is the reason it doesn’t work, we could maybe
          get rid of that prompt to make it work better in the SAML
          case

    -   PHil

        -   Yes — understood this was just based off of standard Chrome

    -   Achim

        -   Seems to me, from pure user perspective, assuming redirects,
          only bearable thing from users perspective, need proxy to
          retain authenticated credentials

        -   But that would require system re-work

    -   Phil

        -   Yes

    -   Nicolas

        -   Mostly curious — demoing how it would work using FedCM

        -   Curious — without FedCM, what part of it breaks wrt 3P
          cookies?

    -   Phil

        -   Probably doesn’t

        -   302 redirects through proxies

        -   Unless proxy requires 3P embeds

        -   Mostly exploring SAML adjacent issues

        -   Probably not something you’d need to

    -   Johann

        -   In 3P cookie world through FedCM

        -   Would it be helpful to have 3P cookie access?

    -   Phil

        -   Certainly some implementations that some providers might
          have 3P cookie requirements in potential intermediate
          state

    -   Johann

        -   Yes — it seems that among some other SAML providers, there
          are some proxies that can’t keep their state in the
          redirect flows

    -   Achim

        -   Adjacent to my question

        -   Proxies often not the case that you want the proxies to have
          independent authentication state that idps cannot change

        -   Because that is tricky

    -   Heather

        -   Hoping to do another SAML adjacent demo of logout next week

        -   A handful of critical use-cases where that is being used

        -   More critical services do (lots of social use-cases do not
          use logout but critical ones do)

    -   Matthew

        -   Backchannel communications

        -   Have a bunch of comments on that

        -   Not sure how to file that in GitHub — how to do that?

        -   In particular, back-channel from protocol perspective

        -   Not sure where to put the writtup

        -   Has to do with regulatory limitations on server-to-server
          communications in environments I’m familiar with.

        -   Not sure where to post that?

    -   Heather

        -   Just go ahead and create another issue for that

        -   If Chrome people aligns with that, they will point out
          related thread to bring it to

        -   But for starters just create a new issue, and we’ll go from
          there

    -
