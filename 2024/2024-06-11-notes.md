### CrossSiteCookieAccessCredential

Ben

- Moving the login url behind .well-known
- (Ben presenting)
- Issue is that before if you wanted (an IdP that has not yet been visited or logged into)
- If you go to a page, how to allow users to go to that IdP?
- Before, there was an account chooser
- It would say “use your account at IdP.com”
- Sam opposed to that — move login URL behind a .well-known file
- Not a bad suggestion, but not sure we need to put the login URL behind a .well-known?
- Instead, just put it behind a user action
- Would like feedback on that use-case

Sam

- Matches intuition, lots of moving parts
- Knowing holistically what potential mitigations in the future are important
- Need to make FeDCM resilient to bounce-tracking
- Mitigations to top-level navigation and pop-ups are still under development
- Idea of having pop-ups also partitioned by opener?
- Bounce-tracking is still a problem, so still trying to make FedCM bounce-tracking resilient
- But still understand that .well-known is somewhat painful in some circumstances

Ben

- Making navigation and tracking orthogonal use-cases seems easier than trying to solve them both at once

Sam

- Smaller problems are better
- But if we know enough about bounce-tracking and mitigations that can be put in place, then this particular suggestion would have a use permission before the pop-up
- Lose the ability for user to use their 1st party credentials
- Tradeoff between asking developers to do more work vs asking users to do more work
- There are more users than developers
- So put more burden on developers
- So even though .well-known file is problematic, might be worth it

Ben

- Not a trade-off
- Prompt vs. putting a pop-up not worse for the user
- Might be better for user as it engages user earlier in decision making
- But understand that maybe it makes more sense to put up a pop-up
  
Sam

- Not necessarily mutually exclusive
- Good trade-off
- But from a threat model perspective, it is game over after that permission prompt
- Then you don’t have to do anything else

Ben

- It isn’t game-over at that point

Sam

- Define game-over
- From tracking perspective, that is when user’s identity in RP can be joined with user’s identity in IdP
- When you open a URL with 1st party cookies from IdP with high entropy from RP, is the moment where tracker would know who the user is

Ben

- Correct, assuming collusion between tracker and RP

Sam

- Correct
- Tracker could use this API exclusively, to get that permission prompt
- Ad networks to get the permissions prompt and get users to accept that permission prompt

Ben

- Go into world where there is a login URL that gets users to login
- Passed by RP

Sam

- From privacy threat model, have to partition 1st party cookies of IdP by opener, or put a permission prompt in front of the user

Ben

- Only if you assume the RP can’t already just open a pop-up window

Sam

- RP can open a pop-up window and can do bounce-tracking

Ben

- Also much quieter — load a 1x1 pixel

Sam

- One of the main points we are using FedCM for is in removing the heuristics of link decoration
- Purpose of FedCM is that it allows vendors to do link decoration
- It has allowed federation to succeed without it
- If we lower the bar for FedCM, it would become the weakest link as we fight bounce-tracking
- Example: Link decoration heuristics in Firefox
- Some heuristics to mitigate bounce-tracking

Johann

- Talking about this with Ben a bit
- Wanted to ground this on some of the things we agree on
- Agreed that permission prompt isn't a great idea — would rather not burden the user with that
- If we don’t do a .well-known file or permission prompt, exposes FedCM to bounce-tracking attacks
- If we are building a new mode, why would we want to expose the same vulnerabilities?
- Counter: .well-known files are difficult for people to deploy
- If there is so much feedback that this is too hard, maybe consider having the user do a bit more work (to maintain the secure properties)

Sam

- Matches intuition — understand conundrum between two bad choices
- From sequencing perspective, maybe make something that is more ergonomic rather than starting the other way around

Judith

- When you say .well-known is hard for developers — assuming that is for implementers, in enterprise and education where top level is managed in one place but application is managed elsewhere
- So it’s not just developers — application maintainers too

Johann

- Agree — it’s not Just developers

Ben

- Already feedback that .well-known file in top level of site is cumbersome
- Entirely calls out enterprise use cases where there are different logins for different top level domains — mitigates that issue
- And is overly burdensome for many people

Johann

- Third – notify the developer that their FedCM is fatal because there are no available credentials
- So the RP can then take appropriate action – partitioned pop-in or other way to get credentials

George

- There are ways in .well-known — OAuth metadata server is a possible mechanism to support multiple .well-knowns off a single top-level domain

Aaron

- Difference between top level .well-known vs subdomain .well-known
- So having to put something on root level vs. application code running on a subdomain
- Marketing team runs main site but actual code is on accounts.idp.com

Ben

- To clarify — the thing we’re talking about putting login URL is in the top-level site — so much harder
- To George’s point, is to propose to make it only one Login URL per site
- To prevent navigational tracking to cut off all those other use cases
- Seems like there isn’t a good conclusion yet so will leave as open question in Explainer

### FedCM

Tim

- Any new implementations?
- RPs or anything else

Sam

- IdP Registration API
- Numerous others have popped up as new potential interested parties
- Sam / Aaron Parecki / Sebastian have implemented in Raafi (?) / Anders has implemented it in LastLogin
- All very early implementations behind flags, but exciting that 5 or 6 new people are experimenting with IdP Registration APIs
- Coming from individuals who have IdPs they want to put forward as IdPs to use to login with

Allow RPs some control over the prompt

Sam

- Christian is pushing this
- Allow RPs some control over what the UX prompt looks like
- Today it tells that a Name, Email address, and picture will be shared
- This allows RP to select for only some of those fields to be shared or not ask for any of those fields at all
- That’s the problem we’re trying to solve — allow RPs some control over what is being asked
- These field requests also get passed down to IdPs AFTER the user has accepted the FedCM permission prompt
- Similar to the Claims parameter in OIDC
- Also similar to Query Languages in OpenID for VP discussions
- Currently implemented in Chrome Canaries
- Also in Chrome Stable as Origin Trial in Chrome M126, which comes out today
- More of a work in progress
- Doesn’t give full expressivity of a query language

Tim

- Looking for people to play with and give feedback?

Sam

- Yes — but it is very limited today — use existing things OR skip disclosure prompt altogether
- In which case it would be IdP to gather disclosure from user using either the Continuation API or other mechanism

Elf

- Seems somehow similar to contact picker API
- Not sure how many implementations there are
- User Experience should maybe be similar to Contact Picker API and FedCM

Sam

- Yes — interesting analogy
- Somewhat different in that Contact Picker is coming from contacts stored in OS vs data coming from IdP
- But still there are similarities — will take a look more
- Arbitrary parameters on the endpoint

Sam

- Also available in Chrome Stable M126 origin trial
- Not New functionality but now more ergonomic way to pass arbitrary parameter from RP to IdP
- It’s a dict of parameters
- RP can pass anything to IdP
- Opaque to browser
- Analogy in Digital Credential API called “request”
- Expect them to be done over top-level redirect — OIDC params / SAML Parameters
- Scope, Nonce, etc., is the intention of this object
- Feature is generally uncontroversial
- Controversial part is how to accomplish it
- Has to do with whether we prefix the FedCM params vs. prefixing the “param” parameters.
- Reuse OAuth servers and make it as easy as possible to reuse them with as few changes as possible

Aaron

- In the discussion, there was a suggestion to let the RP choose which sets of params get prefixed
- Where was that?

Sam

- Not sure if we looked at that option for the current implementation
- Haven’t thought about it more yet

Aaron

- Seems like that would be a better way to address the problem?

Brian

- Only loosely following
- Any reason why this endpoint is not taking a JSON post body vs. form parameters?
- Talking about isolating / namespacing
- Having it be a JSON

Aaron

- Forces you to treat it as a new endpoint
- You can almost use auth endpoint as-is, if it was a JSON body
- As opposed to having to strip params first

Brian

- Also people have considered this to be similar to token endpoint
- Making it separate would probably make more sense

Sam

- Would definitely welcome feedback
- Existing production people wanted this to be separate from existing endpoints

Brian

- Philip was arguing for the endpoints to be the same, though
- So getting arguments in both directions

Sam

- Seems to be the key architectural decision
- Is this the same or different?

Brian

- Seems like it should be wholly different, but would like to hear about more people

Sam

- Maybe OAuth and SAML community could consider whether it should be same or different endpoints

Judith

- For SAML — it will be different

Aaron

- Started by turning Auth endpoint into FedCM endpoint
- Then made more sense to re-use internal functions as different endpoints
- So ended up making new endpoint anyway

Sam

- Seemed to match intuition
- Have to open that endpoint in very specific ways for FedCM
- CORS restrictions
- Sec-Fetch-XXX headers also
- Wouldn’t want to expose production endpoints to new sources of traffic that have different properties

Aaron

- Don’t want to add FedCM to existing OAuth endpoints

Sam

- Still need to do more in-depth

Ben

- Counter: Two endpoints that look the same unless you squint leads to having a separate, JS-based system, as a better alternative.

Sam

- SAA Autogrant is now in Origin Trials — if you go through FedCM you also will get SAA Auto-grant too now (as of M126)
- But still agree with Ben that in user-land might be best

George

- Re: Don’t mess up existing auth endpoint to give users a good experience
- But in webspace world, the only truly good option would be FedCM
- But Mobile Apps would be doing something native-ish
- If you were doing PAR+WebView, how could this end up triggering bad experiences?
- Not sure about all the pros and cons and tradeoffs of all those spaces

Judith

- Checking with others — hearing that FedCM makes it possible for bounce-tracking not have to take into account authentication flows is a bit concern
- Lots of demos in Edu space were that redirects in the login window would continue to work
- Is there a vision that FedCm is also solving bounce-tracking

Sam

- Not solving issue of bounce-tracking
- So far have kept bar of FedCM being resilient to Bounce-tracking
- If a browser would want to mitigate bounce-tracking, FedCM would not compromise

Judith

- All concerns about how Authentication has changed from site to site
- Last year — assurances were that redirects would still work through the chain
- The challenge of how to solve the problem of not telling RP enough and having to send users to some other entity
- If there is a vision that FedCM will solve all Federated Authentication, then we have to solve how communication to intermediaries will work via redirect chains in OIDC and SAML 

Tim

- Judith can you summarize that in an issue?

Judith

- Yes — will maybe send email with details

Ben

- Those use cases are called out as explicit use cases that the LWC will handle

### FedID WG Charter

Simone

- If you are curious, you can follow the Fed ID WG link
- Definition of privacy is an issue but not a lot of changes yet
