Notes
=====

-   FedID Working Group update

    -   [<u>Officially opened</u>](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/)
     on Mar 28th

    -   W3C members that are interested in joining should review via
     their legal teams

    -   9 members in WG so far (does not yet include Google, Mozilla,
     Apple)

    -   first meeting expected in May

    -   Anyone else who wants to join, go through [<u>the request
     process</u>](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/join/)

    -   Also, previous discussion on whether Digital Credentials should
     be added to FedID WG

    -   Wasn’t blocking for initial formation

    -   A number of people objected to including Digital Credentials in
     WG as it wasn’t yet mature enough

    -   So, Charter was approved for FedCM only, and then started larger
     discussion to determine what would be needed to add Digital
     Credentials work to it

    -   Issue currently open in GitHub: [<u>Adding Digital Credentials
     to the FedID
     WG</u>](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/450)

    -   Starting to have that conversation there

    -   Nick Doty chimed in with a thought

    -   If you’re bringing in Digital Credentials from Wallet
     perspective

    -   Wants consideration of potential harms, impact, privacy
     considerations

    -   Ideally, having a document in conjunction with Ping / Privacy WG
     on the implications of Digital Identity on the Web, best
     practices, and what could go wrong

    -   If that was a joint deliverable in the updated charter, that
     should address Nick’s concerns

    -   So, do people think that this would be reasonable?

    -   Digital Credentials are in the WICG as the Digital Identities
     work item

    -   John Bradley

        -   We should consider the consequences of what we do

        -   Could use SAML OIDC or 3-party Wallet systems

        -   All have similar-ish privacy issues

        -   If you disclose what wallets you have up front, someone
         might discover the country you are from

        -   Or, if you are using OIDC and using Clabiunica, someone
         might discover you are from Chile

        -   Nick’s concerns aren’t unreasonable

        -   We’re likely to make it easier to allow people to disclose
         personal attributes to websites

        -   FedCM isn’t going to make it that much more convenient

        -   Likely one of the two proposals will make it easier to
         disclose attributes than the other

        -   RPs will always want users’ attributes

        -   As soon as advertising entered the Web, RPs wanted
         attributes

        -   So the question is, what kind of balance and controls should
         we put in?

        -   Good for us to explore

        -   Some people are interested in WICG and to have it include
         IPR, some governments have taken interest

        -   No formal IPR around when developed by browsers, how do we
         regulate this?

        -   Motivation for people (very recently) to formalize it so it
         is referenceable (in regulations)

        -   If taking privacy issues into account is part of that, that
         would be fine

    -   Brian Campbell

        -   Digital Credentials definitely feels a lot less mature

        -   So, not sure what the push was to get it into the WG charter

    -   John Bradley

        -   Wanting to have Digital Credentials referenceable for EU and
         US regulations is a big push to have its work in a WG

    -   Heather

        -   Referenceability for regulations is one angle

        -   But readiness for WG is also a consideration and should be
         discussed

        -   Not sure what “ready for WG” looks like

    -   John

        -   Artifact of the way W3C does things

        -   Pre-ready stuff in IETF is an individual submission

        -   Someone decides whether it gets adopted by a WG

        -   Someone submits it to the WG and the WG decides

        -   More actual work tends to actually happen in WGs in IETF

        -   Facts are that in W3C, browsers implement features to create
         a de-facto standard that will end up standardized in WGs

        -   If it is left in WICG for longer, it will be more into a
         final specification before hitting a WG

        -   Pluses and Minuses for both approaches

    -   Ben

        -   FedCM perhaps more overcooked in this CG than typical W3C
         CG-&gt;WG process

        -   So that might add to the confusion too

        -   Also, does adding a document deliverable considering the
         impacts sound good?

        -   A lot of the WG charter is written with FedCM in mind than
         with both Digital is Credentials in mind as well

        -   Also, to John, FF is not among the browsers that it is
         necessarily a good thing and marching forward with an
         implementation without a spec that it is fleshed out

    -   JohnB

        -   Seems to be driven by entities that have digital wallets and
         Product Managers that are wondering when it will be done

    -   Ben

        -   A bit of a chicken and egg problem in terms of initiating
         the spec vs implementation

    -   Heather

        -   Nick did attend the meeting yesterday

        -   Tess had asked what the blockers were to changing the
         charter

        -   Nick said if we added the document, that would potentially
         be ok

        -   But…this document could be ever-so-much bigger as it could
         tackle all of digital identity on the web

        -   And what about verifiable credentials work? Would that be
         included as well? That is potentially huge addition in
         scope

        -   But if we bring in digital wallet work, that touches on VCs

        -   Will have a call with Nick

    -   Achim

        -   Along the same lines

        -   Adding a deliverable here would not mean that the WG could
         deliver on it

        -   It’s a completely different question — requires completely
         different people to discuss

        -   With FedCM, we had lots of discussions and carved out the
         API

        -   So, adding the doc seems nice from a unblocking perspective

    -   Heather

        -   It is a joint deliverable

    -   Achim

        -   Would it block finalizing something on the technical side?

        -   People in the EU are looking to finalize specs for wallets
         and won’t wait 2 years for that

    -   Heather

        -   If people have additional ideas, put them into Issue 450
         [<u>Adding Digital Credentials to the FedID
         WG</u>](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/450), and
         they will be captured

        -   Expect this proposal will be sent out tomorrow

        -   Will come up in IIW next week, too

-   IIW

    -   Next week!

    -   Tim Cappalli has started session planning doc

        -   [<u>IIW Spring 2024 - DC Session
         Planning</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hy-U-JTP5ggiUoS-fY64eTY4hNSXOf2jb9AQIlh4gjc/edit?pli=1#heading=h.erni6mw9192d)

    -   This is mostly coming out of the WICG work

    -   Topics (see document above)

        -   Their API

        -   \#2

        -   Adding the Digital Credentials work to FedID WG

    -   Very informal conversation of interested parties — not official
     W3C thing

    -   See if there’s consensus to move that forward

    -   Anything else to cover next week?

    -   No FedID CG call next week due to IIW

-   Slides from [<u>Identity on the
 Web</u>](https://www.w3.org/2024/Talks/ac-slides/identity/) (W3C

    -   Heather did this presentation to the W3C Advisory Committee

    -   Asked the AC to think about the W3C’s role in Digital Identity
     and what that might be

    -   Had really good discussion afterwards + breakout session

    -   Notes should be coming out soon

    -   Slides are public

    -   Top Slide: Galaxy of Digital Identity orgs and what they working
     on

-   Lightweight Cookie Access Credentials

        -   (nothing merged yet though)

-   Next call will be on Apr 23rd

    -   Will check in to see how LWCs are going
