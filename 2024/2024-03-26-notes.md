Notes
=====

FedID WG — Update
-----------------

-   Simone

    -   Will announce the WG imminently

    -   Next: Call for Participation

    -   And once that’s accomplished, it can officially start

    -   Will determine about Virtual meeting vs. face-to-face at or
     before TPAC

-   Tim

    -   Idea is for FedID CG to still be paired with the FedID WG

-   Sam

    -   Strategy was to form the WG quickly and then add the Digital
     Credentials effort after that, as a separate addition

-   Philippe

    -   Advisory committee meeting in 2 weeks in Japan (April 8-9)

    -   Focus is Identity on the Web

    -   Won’t do any more on Digital Credentials until after that
     meeting

    -   Then: Horizontal review of Charter, with consideration of adding
     Digital Credentials

    -   Already asked TAG to review Digital Credentials

    -   Will also need review from Privacy people on addition of DCs to
     the Charter

    -   Expected to take about a month

    -   Expected by mid-May will have done reviews, then AC review

    -   So, by mid-to-end of June, expect to have DCs as part of the
     Charter

    -   Of course, if any objections arise, we would have to address
     them

-   Sam

    -   Objections so far?

-   Philippe

    -   Too early at the moment, but some people had expressed some
     concerns

    -   Will report back after that meeting in 2 weeks in Japan

    -   Heather will be remotely attending that meeting

    -   (the meeting is not just Digital Credentials, but that is part
     of it)

    -   Also: the TAG can sometimes take 3 months before responding

    -   Hopefully will hear from TAG by mid-May

Cross Site Cookie Access Credential
-----------------------------------

-   Ben

    -   &lt;presenting Cross Site Cookie Access Credential proposal from
     GitHub&gt;

    -   This is the new work

    -   Lighter-weight way to pass credentials to browser between IdPs
     and RPs

    -   New work is how to integrate with FedCM

    -   Wanted to bring to group idea of making it part of FedCM as a
     different operating mode

    -   Would be in the same namespace as FedCM

    -   Call for interaction on Issue \#4

    -   Please look at this proposal and we’ll discuss next week

IdP Registration API
--------------------

-   Sam

    -   Just to report back: we’ve been working on this for a while

    -   At a point where there is a prototype

    -   Rough Privacy & Security guidance that it is a solvable problem

    -   Now assessing Developer Demand

    -   We put features behind flags and monitor how many people try it
     out

    -   There are instructions on how to use it

    -   Encourage people to try it out

    -   Won’t move forward until people actually use it and ask for
     additional development

    -   Generally trying to assess product-market fit for Developers

    -   So, it will be in this stage until people try it out

    -   If no usage / demand in a year, then will likely remove the code

-   Tim

    -   What is the window for people to try it out?

-   Sam

    -   Self-imposed deadline

    -   Chrome separates DevTrials from Origin Trials / Launching

    -   DevTrials asks developers to try it out by turning on flags

    -   If lots of demand, it will go to Origin Trials where we expect
     developers to try it out against real users

    -   Then, assuming Origin Trial goes well, it will be launched

    -   Also more art than science to know how many developers we’d need
     to gauge demand

    -   But if one big IdP picked it up, that would probably be enough
     to take it to Origin Trials within a month or so (depending on
     any changes required)

-   Tim

    -   Anyone already playing with this or intending to?

-   Sam

    -   Solid community had said they were interested

    -   And a second one — Seamless Access folks maybe?

    -   Heard that it was worth building, but will have to see if they
     find it useful

    -   It’s possible that we got it wrong — just need to know where

-   Chris

    -   R&E Sector is about having clarity for ourselves where discovery
     of thousands of IdPs happens

    -   Will it be played with by us — yes

    -   Is it a replacement for Discover-my-idP? Or is it just the
     registration role?

-   Sam

    -   Not sure what role it plays — need for people to try it out to
     see exactly where it fits — and we can figure that out
     together with people who try it out

    -   If there are things we could change to make life better, we
     should be able to do that

    -   It seems that there are various things that can be improved in
     the R&E space, but need people to try it to see what those
     things are

Intent to Prototype: FedCM as a trust signal for the Storage Access API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Tim

    -   Not sure if anyone has had

-   Yi

    -   We just sent out Intent to Prototype

    -   Patch is up for review

    -   Trying to get some feedback and solve more use cases

    -   Limitation of SAA and where FedCM could help with that access

    -   Idea is to put it behind a flag and let people try it out to see
     if it actually solves people’s problems or what might need to
     be changed if needed

IIW Sprint 2024
---------------

-   Tim

    -   Document started for IIW, for Digital Credentials work

    -   Want to be more organized ahead of time to optimize the meeting
