# Notes

Charter

HF: So far it is going well, vote open for one more week. It will feed into discussions at TPAC.

Schedule

HF: Next calls on September 10 and 17\. Good part of today’s call will be planning for TPAC.

[Passing arbitrary parameters to the ID assertion endpoint \#556](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/issues/556)

Christian: Before elf’s comment, we were setting on passing serialized JSON as the params. Elf suggested sending the entire body as application/json instead of urlencoded. Besides backwards compatibility, it also requires CORS preflight.

Phil: First was the CORS preflight; second about prefixing the params. 

Christian: The two options are keeping the urlencoded and sending a single parameter, no matter the name currently params. Option two is sending the entire request as a JSON object with application/json content type. The params would be the dictionary. Few existing IdPs would have to change. It would trigger CORS preflight, which we should consider.

Judith: SAML uses redirect and the whole request is urlencoded. Putting this in the body doesn’t sound like the problem, except that I’m not familiar with what this CORS preflight would look like.

Christian: On the browser side it is mostly automatic, just the IdP would have to support it. Adding extra headers. Assuming proper IdP response, the actual request happens.

Phil: It will send the origin in the preflight. IdP needs to check that origin during the preflight stage. Currently, the assertion endpoint gets everything, and then it makes the decision based on the origin. In this case, it will just get the origin in the first request (the preflight).

Christian: In the sense, it is not the final response. But it is a good point that the OPTIONS request doesn’t have the client\_id.

Phil: It could just say yes on preflight and then get all the information

George: If we are sending params inside of JSON and want to sign, there is some work done in that field. OIDC defines a signed request object which got morphed into RFC\#\#\#\#… There are some additional requirements. Some good thoughts can be leveraged from those specifications.

Christian: I think this would work with either proposal. In the first case, the JSON object is just for the params; in the other, it is the whole request. I need to read that spec again.

Christian: My take is that it seems that IdPs are ok with sending the whole request as JSON

George: Given that it is a different endpoint, probably it is not so much of a problem for IdP. You can grab it from the endpoint and pass it to your internal engine.

Phil: Nothing will work without the params object. 

Aaron: I’m in the same boat, as long as it is possible to add custom parameters and as long as it can be more complex than strings, it is fine anyway. Especially as we consider it a new endpoint. Some processing has to happen anyway. I’m supportive of dropping the prefixing, and either option seems fine.

TPAC

Heather: Two meeting times listed on the top of the agenda. I’m going to create a tag on github so that you can tag issues that need indepth quality time. Is there anything that you all know you will want to talk about? There is a remote access for each meeting, you just need to [register](https://www.w3.org/register/tpac2024/form) via \<[https://www.w3.org/register/tpac2024/form](https://www.w3.org/register/tpac2024/form)\>. There is also a question about wearing masks. Only two responses without a preference.

Heather: We are going to discuss the digital credential api. There are people mostly interested in FedCM and some people mostly interested in digital credential API, but everyone should be at least familiar with both proposals.

Sam: There is a digital credentials CG session happening on ??? .

Heather: I will find out when and add it to the meeting notes. I need to talk with Tim about the status of the spec, if it is ready to migrate into WG or more incubation needs to happen.

Nicolas: Do we plan to discuss stages of the spec during TPAC?

Heather: Do you mean the mechanics of the stages?

Nicolas: Yes, for the features.

Heather: I expect to have a call next week and I invite you to go over open issues and use the TPAC tag.

Phil: The multi IdP is in the origin trial?

Sam: We do not have multiple IdP origin trials; you can only try it in Chrome stable desktop. The other big one is digital credential origin trial. The next planned one is…

Nicolas: We are not planning to prioritize Android implementation. We are going to work on getting a more polished alignment for desktop. We need more evidence of use from our key partners, who are not ready for Android yet. I want to mention two other origin trials: the button mode is now available on Android. If the user clicks, you can surface some UI regarding whether the user is logged in or not. It is available in desktop and Android. The other one is an authorization bundle with continuation api. Also available on both desktop and Android. So together we have those four updates. You can file issues on github or crbug. 

Phil: To confirm, multi idp not supported in button mode, only widget?

Nicolas: I think the UI for button support is much trickier. This will be an interesting discussion with the UX team. Multi IdP only works in widget mode.

Sam: There is a reason why we started with the widget not button mode. By the time you click a button, the user has already selected an IdP. If you think it will be constructive to support it, we can take a look at it.

Phil: We use seamless access. If I use widget mode, that would exclude the IdP which I wasn’t signed in to. Maybe both modes are not needed; another mode could allow additional …

Nicolas: IdP selection is the key thing. There is a question: what if you are logged out? The question is when the selection should happen. 

Phil: We have some decent approaches. I'm happy to chat again about it.

Nicolas: We could do it during the TPAC, maybe.

Heather: I can resend you a link where … has focused their attention when to select IdP.

Judith: You asserted things about when I’m logged in. Different people use different identities to use different things. People need a choice. I almost messed up the UI and took the choice away which made me very aware of it.

Sam: We have enough partnerships for everything except the multiple IdPs. If any of you will be willing to gather evidence of demand for multi IdP in origin trials, it would be great. We have one partnership starting trial today but more would be great.

Heather: I plan to talk to the IdP community; they could help test implementations and provide feedback.

Phil: 

Heather: Please tag issues for TPAC ([tpac2024](https://github.com/w3c-fedid/FedCM/labels/tpac2024))
