Notes
=====

-   Security Primer / Best Practices / Guidelines for using FedCM -
 [<u>issue 536</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/536)

-   Heather

    -   Not much documentation on how everything interacts with OAuth

    -   Wanted to start conversation on how FedCM interacts with OAuth

    -   Next meeting is in March

    -   Chairs of OAuth would read through FedCM (last time they looked
 was \~3 years ago)

    -   Re-familiarize themselves

    -   Mention it in OAuth WG meeting in Brisbane

    -   Then submit something to OAuth Security Workshop in April in
 (Rome, April 10-12)
 [<u>https://oauth.secworkshop.events/</u>](https://oauth.secworkshop.events/)

    -   Would be good time to focus on privacy implications between
 OAuth and FedCM

    -   Also: Focus time & attention at IIW (week after in Mountain
 View, April 16-18)
 [<u>https://internetidentityworkshop.com/</u>](https://internetidentityworkshop.com/)

 Specifically
 https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-iiwxxxviii-38-2024a-tickets-775719386567?aff=oddtdtcreator

-   Want to take advantage of unconference format of IIW to determine
 what is missing / what additional conversations have to happen

-   Maybe have interim meeting with OAuth WG - virtual format, use IETF
 infrastructure

-   Might be useful once we have a better plan on what we want to do

-   Still TODO: OpenID Connect aspect of things

-   OIDC is a profile on top of OAuth

-   Making sure there is awareness and engagement in OIDC

-   95% overlap of people in OAuth and OIDC - so cross-pollination
 shouldn’t be too different

<!-- -->

-   Sam

    -   That's exactly right – had initial meeting with OAuth chairs

    -   Lots of alignment and common interest

    -   Not sure how to navigate between Open ID Foundation and OAuth WG

    -   Layering it seems to be the right approach

    -   Workshop in Rome is in-person only

    -   Tim kicked off a thread to get us into the schedule – not sure
 if that will succeed - waiting to hear back

    -   And IIW

    -   Also would like to do something a bit scrappier in this CG

    -   IETF work might be a bit slower due to increased rigor

    -   Maybe we can kick of discussion early here in CG to sanity check
 basic ideas

    -   We’re starting to see smaller IDPs in the wild

    -   Not sure we have appropriate recommendations to give those
 smaller IDPs

    -   Security properties, etc. in particulars

    -   Delegated a lot of this to Ecosystem, historically, but want to
 steer Ecosystem in the right direction.

    -   Would like to incubate some of the major ideas here, as we have
 the experts here

-   Heather

    -   Incubate ideas – suggesting that we start a document?

-   Sam

    -   Yes start a document with our collective knowledge of OAuth and
 FedCM and OIDC

    -   And Chrome would point devs at that doc

    -   FedCM is opinionated about the protocol that happens through it

    -   No mention of JWTs, Nonces, how to prevent replay attacks, etc.

    -   By design FedCM gets out of the way of those

    -   But developers don't have a basis on how to use FedCM (from
 those perspectives)

    -   In contrast, OIDC / OAuth experts in this CG have been deploying
 these systems for decades.

-   Heather

    -   Additional thoughts or ideas?

    -   Under the impression that there are a lot of different ways that
 the OAuth protocol (and SAML) could be used

    -   Here’s a way to do it to respect proper Privacy and Security
 principles we might want a reference architecture on how to do
 it properly to preserve those principles (out of potentially
 multiple alternatives)

    -   Is that correct?

    -   If we wanted to create documentation that from the FedCM
 perspective here’s how to avoid particular security issues …

    -   Not sure how to scope this in a reasonable way

-   Sam

    -   Was thinking a document that could eventually turn into an IETF
 RFC

    -   Forms meat and bones of eventual RFC

-   Heather

    -   Not worried about format, worried about he scope

-   Sam

    -   RFC would be the scope

    -   THinking of it as a “binding” to OAuth

    -   In OAuth spec - do a top-level navigation to IDP, then do a
 top-level nav with redirect URL, or open an iframe (similar
 examples from OIDC spec)

    -   Might imagine an extra clause that if you were operating with a
 FedCM capable user agent, make this JS call to FedCM instead
 of those redirects

    -   Conceptually, from a layering perspective, a binding to SAML or
 OAuth

-   Phillip

    -   For SAML that would be the right thinking (a new binding to
 SAML)

    -   In Open ID you have response modes where you can post back to a
 redirect URL

-   Sam

    -   Not sure what final answer is, but seems like we have the
 experts in this CG

        -   (George / Tim / John Bradley / etc.)

-   Achim

    -   Idea is generally correct, having said that having a binding to
 FedCM to OIDC

    -   Redirects and URL parameter are fundamental core concepts down
 to Oauth

    -   Long-term you’d have to add a specific segment in OAuth because
 the flow is now different

    -   Agree to the problem statement that the FedCM does not describe
 at all how the login process actually does in depth (OIDC or
 SAML)

    -   So, guidance can be helpful

-   Sam

    -   Some people are of opinion that FedCM is conceptually different
 than top-level redirects or iframes, that just being a
 “binding” is not necessarily appropriate because top-level
 assumptions are fundamentally change to those protocols’ flows

    -   FedCM has a lot of UX involved, whereas OIDC / OAuth / SAML do
 not typical

    -   Implicit flows have been frowned upon for a while in OAuth due
 to, in part, concerns about redirects getting into URL history
 / bookmarks, etc.

    -   No guarantee that payload will be returned to originating origin

    -   Should start to get FedCM as part of OAuth rather than starting
 something completely new

-   Ben

    -   Raises potential utility to have binding of FeDCM to OAuth that
 may not have as much as its own UX that exercises IDP control
 that more-quickly tries to step out of the way

    -   Maybe try to carve that out?

    -   Will get harder and harder to do with the arrival of more
 smaller adopters

    -   So maybe do it sooner than later

-   Heather

    -   Question for Ben: Firm believer in simpler is better and getting
 out of the way

    -   HOw to get there from where we are?

    -   Whiteboard session to hash it out?

    -   Proposal that Ben had from a while ago

-   Ben

    -   Hasn’t changed much – haven’t put all newest context back

    -   Maybe a whiteboard session would be good

    -   Would be good to see what this might look like if we wanted a
 minimal

-   Heather

    -   Next week is Pacific call - Atlantic session would normally be
 canceled

    -   Maybe use the normal Atlantic time slot to do that whiteboard
 session?

    -   Seems like Yes

    -   Will reach out to George and Tim and John Bradley to see if they
 can help

    -   So, consider next week’s Atlantic time slot to draw out some of
 the ideas Ben has in his head

-   Sam

    -   Point that Ben raised is very valid

    -   Actively interested in working on

    -   Materializing more in terms of Auto-Granting Storage Access API
 call

    -   Part of the intersection is based on Auto-Granting SAA after
 FedCM consent has happened

    -   Other idea with Johann Hofmann about finding a way to decrease
 cost of operating FedCM by not requiring IDP to spin up
 endpoints for fedCM

    -   Intersection of that – would like to have folks like Johann and
 maybe [<u>Kaustubha Govind</u>](mailto:kaustubhag@google.com)
 there too

    -   Somewhat orthogonal to autogranting vs OAuth binding

    -   Whiteboard session is perfectly valid but won’t be sufficient to
 form guidelines to the Ecosystem

-   Ben

    -   Johann has mentioned an idea like that previously but not
 details yet

    -   Would like to see how / where this bumps into SAA

    -   Thinking about alternative designs would be good while still in
 incubation stage

-   Heather

    -   Will reach out to Johann to see if he is available next week

-   Sam

    -   Johann was worried about taking too many steps back

    -   Other group working on Lightweight Credentials is Digital
 Identities CG that is thinking about wallets

    -   Also thinking about thinking of storing credentials in wallets
 without having to spin up servers

    -   But that’s in much earlier stages of incubation

    -   Sense of urgency exists in terms of 3PCD which is closer to our
 work than Digital Identities CG

-   Heather

    -   Def area of consideration, but don’t want to re-litigate things
 that have been settled already in FedCM

    -   Lots of overlap between FeDCM and DigID CG

    -   Maybe let’s wait for that a little bit

-   Achim

    -   Same topics are cropping up in Wallets space too as they operate
 on top of OAuth as well

    -   Schemes are similar – protocols use redirects

    -   Allows you to claim something that looks like a redirect but
 actually isn’t one (?)

    -   Also more fruitful to think in terms of deployments

    -   Where are similarities for deployments if you push something
 through FeDCM

    -   How can you deploy with least amount of work with as much infra
 you already have in context of OAuth where you already have a
 token

    -   Which checks can be done where?

    -   Could be better than plain redirect?

    -   Similar topics in both CGs and following WGs

    -   Fundamental change if you have these types of APIs (FedCM and
 Digital Identity APIs)

-   [<u>Why does Privacy Sandbox's FedCM explainer say SAML is not
 well-supported by
 FedCM?</u>](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues/122)

-   Heather

    -   Questions recently about SAML

    -   Question about whether SAML will be broken by 3PCD

    -   No specification about in SAML about \#P cookies

    -   Global logout might be affected

    -   Seamless access which is part of IDP discovery heavily used by
 SAML community

    -   Might be part of where people are getting confused

    -   Talking about SAML in a very narrow way

-   Sam

    -   Messages we are getting from SAML operators is that they are
 depending on 3P cookies

    -   Feel like Authentication mechanism is one of the large number of
 services they provide

    -   So we’ve been told SAML doesn’t break with 3P Cookie Deprecation

    -   But all the operators are coming back saying “no no it actually
 does break because of these auxiliary operations”

-   Achim

    -   Depends on definition of “break”

    -   If it doesn’t technically break but it is a horrible user
 experience

-   Heather

    -   In terms of practical implications, a lot of that is what Phil
 has been testing

-   Phil

    -   Gets involved with tracking mitigations with proxies

    -   When you combine the whole store, it gets more involved

    -   If your IDP operates in an embed that could be issue

-   Sam

    -   We’re getting these comments that even today tbat SAML servers’
 operations “break” with the 3PCD that is starting to roll out

    -   Embedded uses are outside of SAML proper but are part of the
 overall deployment

    -   So if this community could provide guidance that would be great

-   Nicoals

    -   If we could have examples of user flows that actually break
 (SAML) in particular, that would help

-   Heather

    -   Would like to take this offline with Shannon Zaccharias Mathew
 and Phil to come up with a reasonable presentation on what
 this looks like from SAML communities

    -   And comb back in 2 weeks

-   Matthew

    -   Would need to get everything done before 15th of Feb due to
 external constraints

-   Heather

    -   Good

    -   Any Questions / Comments?

    -   Segue to AOB: Multi-IDP update from Phil

-   Phil

    -   Issues if you had two idps and neither was logged in it would
 pop up window for first and then second and had to
 authenticate to both

    -   No longer happens with Multi-IDP which is good

    -   Seems to work relatively well

    -   Still have 1000 IDP issue

    -   But for the limited case we are discussing works well

    -   FedCM dialog is in top right hand corner sometimes it popped up
 another dialog in middle of browser window

    -   Picture is in the issue

    -   Was different / unexpected dialog in the middle

    -   Also crashed occasionally

    -   Is it getting confused with other experimental features?

    -   In general it did work in expected way

-   Nicolas

    -   Looks like Button Mode API

    -   Had flag enabled and did call with that

    -   That would probably result in crashes

    -   Don’t have multiple iDP support with button mode

-   Avhim

    -   Saw this when you are signed in with one IDP signed out of
 another IDP

    -   Doesn’t match sign-in state

-   Nicolas

    -   That’s not how mis-matched UI looks

    -   That is the button account chooser UI

    -   Wondering if you are using the Get call even with the button

    -   SHouldn’t happen on its own though

    -   If both the flag and the API have the button mode that is
 expected

    -   Would be quite bad if both conditions were being met

-   Phil

    -   Will definitely try to strip that out and try it

-   Nicolas

    -   Specific use-case for Multi-IDP in mind?

    -   Would that use-case use button mode or would widget mode be
 sufficient?

-   Phil

    -   Button flow would probably be more useful

    -   If we were doing it with 5000 IDPs would use Seamless access
 first to select the IDP ad then use FedCM with the selected
 IDP

    -   Couldn’t put 5000 IDPs into that FedCm UI

    -   Progress too - but we’d have to do IDP selection first

    -   Some discussion on register-your-idp

    -   But even then it would be federation of 5000 IDPs

    -   So probably unworkable - don’t have the capability for FedCM gto
 represent the scale that we typically have in R&E

-   Nicolas

    -   You’d want the user to select the IDP once and then for later
 RPs that use similar flow to use that IDP?

-   Phil

    -   Yes - currently done by redirect and 3P cookie

-   Nicollas

    -   Yes - good point that it requires more

    -   In your case it is showing no UI

    -   Widget could do that too

    -   Wondering if that would be acceptable?

    -   Would have to have a fallback

    -   And wouldn’t know if showing UI or not

-   Phil

    -   If browser would know that that his is the user’s IDP

    -   IF there was a way for users to register IDP or select IDP that
 would help with selection issue

    -   But don’t want to preclude the user to select an alternate IDP

    -   That’s inside something else

    -   Having the browser understand that this is your IDP is not a bad
 thing at all

    -   Can’t use it or have RP say which IDPs have registered with the
 browser (privacy issues)

    -   No good answer there

    -   Certainly need to handle multiple IDPs, and remember the users’
 selection

    -   20 years of experimentation to make this work so far…

-   Heather

    -   At end now

    -   Will reach out to Johann and others to turn next week into an
 informal whiteboard session
