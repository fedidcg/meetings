 [<u>fedidcg/FedCM\#467</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/467)

    -   Johann

        -   A topic we’ve been hinting at for a while

        -   Explainer is for the idea of auto-granting SAA when FedCM
         Permission prompt has been accepted by the user

        -   Explainer is a bit longer because it includes a lot of
         detail on FedCM and SAA Grants

        -   Want to make them more or less equivalent from privacy
         perspective

        -   Don’t want any privacy loss in this case

        -   All covered in more detail in explainer

        -   Lots of feedback so far — need to improve ergonomics of
         FedCM is a major item

        -   Would like any feedback from this group, too, on API shape,
         usability, etc.

        -   Approach is not to create a new Storage Access permission

        -   But instead taking the FedCM permission and inspect that
         when an iframe calls the SAA

        -   In addition to checking other SAA grants, will check to see
         if there is additional FedCM permission that has been
         given

        -   Privacy equivalent to FedCM is that it has same requirements
         as RP

        -   RP has to opt-in with the same permissions to access 3P
         cookies

        -   Privacy equivalent to using FedCM and

        -   navigator.credentials.get() call is required to access FedCM

        -   Once SAA has been granted it will grant access to 3P cookies

        -   Additional efforts are to enhance headers

        -   Project in Chrome to give access to local storage as well,
         given this type of SAA grant

    -   Heather

        -   Requesting that people read this and come back with
         questions in future meetings

-   [<u>Google Identity rollout of
 FedCM</u>](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/federated-credential-management-migration-for-google-identity-services.html)

    -   Brian Daugherty (see notes below after scribing text)

        -   Walkthrough of approach to FedCM migration + challenges

        -   Google Identity is an IDP

        -   Want to minimize impact on RPs and GIS JS SDK

        -   Impacts on codebase and user gestures, however, with FedCM

        -   Confidence interval: &gt;100K and &lt;2 billion users per
         month

        -   Approx \~140K websites involved in the overall migration

        -   RP perspective: Very much live and breathe on subscribers
         and monthly active sign-ins.

        -   Very sensitive to any downward (and upward) movement on
         those subscription / sign-in numbers

        -   Goal for GIS is to help RPs to help users to sign up and
         subsequently sign in

        -   Deployment has 5 APIs across 2 SDKs (JS)

        -   RPs integrate those SDKs into their Apps

        -   Doc has details on JS and HTML deployments

        -   RP integrations are often non-trivial

        -   Starts with 1 or 2 scenarios

        -   But very often ends up encountering further complexity as
         RPs want to customize the details of their sign-in / AuthN
         / AuthZ efforts

        -   Migration Methods: trying to use the abstraction layer of
         existing API to minimize change that RPs have to do

        -   Want to make it as static as possible

        -   Most of the change is in the JS SDK library

        -   Want to make it as backwards compatible as possible

        -   Allowing partners and developers to elect to use FedCM

        -   So far have seen quite a lot of interest and uptake

        -   A lot of sites are saying they will opt-in, in advance of 3P
         cookie deprecation

        -   Over next 2 quarters will be ramping up all customers onto
         FedCM

        -   So far about 1% — ramping up after that

        -   API layer is the main way we are isolating

        -   Changes that will require manual intervention are covered in
         Developer Migration Guides (there are 2 of them)

        -   Also have several tools

        -   Privacy Sandbox Analysis tools — built into dev tools and
         available as an extension in Chrome

        -   Shows interfaces that will be required to change

        -   Links to dev docs to show details

        -   Lesson learned over time — devs move across companies and/or
         work with contractors, so codebase is so large no single
         person understands the whole thing

        -   Those two tools help a lot to narrow down specific changes
         that need to be made.

        -   Notifications and making devs aware of changes is
         challenging

        -   Dev Console messages are one way but those are already very
         chatty and fedCM messages often get lost

        -   Google blogs is another method

        -   Emails direct to account owners

        -   Leveraging Privacy Sandbox distribution methods

        -   Offer a limited amount of support — but challenging to scale

        -   150K websites

        -   Even if there’s a 1% or 3% support rate, that’s a huge
         volume

        -   Try to answer questions on StackOverflow

        -   Group that is familiar with details of the GIS SDKs and
         FedCM

        -   Often offer advice in community forums

        -   Many many use-cases

        -   FedID CG has helped a lot to uncover lots of new / different
         ways to sign in

        -   Also lots of diversity in websites

        -   Existing JS APIs end up being incorporated into lots of new
         / unanticipated ways

        -   Put into nginx databases

        -   End up being cached

        -   Etc.

        -   Hyrum’s law seems very pertinent — whatever you expected in
         terms of API usage, it will be used in every way possible

        -   Adds additional challenges to deployment / migration

        -   Also: Lots of websites are not maintained — especially
         smaller / medium websites and Edu / Student

        -   Longevity of staff on those projects is also very different

        -   Google doesn’t dictate — suggest approaches / generally
         leading without authority

        -   GIS has been deprecating one of their libraries for 4 years
         so far

        -   Have cut usage by 2/3rds

        -   Thought initially that it would be much easier to eliminate
         usage much faster

        -   But reality is that it takes years, or decades, to finally
         migrate everyone

        -   Power curve in reality

        -   Another example: Internet Explorer was recently shut down
         for good

        -   But that was a very, very, long time to happen

        -   Final challenge: Google’s approach of using API / SDK to
         isolate RPs from updates

        -   Works but only to a point

        -   UX and rendering of FedCM is in the browser, so less ability
         to change that UX arbitrarily when IdPs change

        -   Also Security and Privacy controls

        -   Often maintained by separate groups (e.g., NetOps)

        -   Developer sometimes does that in smaller companies, but in
         larger companies it’s a separate group

        -   So modifying CSP / COOP / CORS takes involvement of numerous
         groups to finally get all these Privacy and Security
         changes staged / released

        -   Takes a lot of calendar time to get everything actually done
         (even if the changes are technically relatively simple)

    -   George

        -   This is about migrating existing GIS sites that leverage the
         existing GIS toolkit to FedCM?

    -   Brian

        -   Yes

        -   Listed 5 different APIs here

        -   So answer is Yes, and… another API exists that is
         semi-deprecated but will also adopt FedCM

    -   George

        -   If it is a really long time period, does that mean some
         things will continue to work for a long time?

        -   How does that feed into the roadmap?

    -   Brian

        -   Timeline for 3PCD is short

        -   Reasonable that we’ll see a percentage of websites that
         don’t act and will have changes pushed onto them

        -   If no active developer to modify the site as necessary,
         impact will be site by site

    -   George

        -   Any suite that is currently working in Safari / Firefox that
         currently works because 3P cookies are gone there should
         be fine / no significant impact?

        -   Unless they were Google Only / Chrome Only sites to begin
         with

        -   In which case they said they weren’t trying to get it
         working in Safari or Firefox

        -   But any that already worked on

    -   Brian

        -   Devil is in the details

        -   If we were able to make fully backwards-compatible changes

        -   ITP browsers require Storage Access and user gestures and
         prompts

        -   Not required for return visits

        -   Discussions going on to try to standardize those gesture
         requirements

        -   That could disrupt RPs and cause issues that might not be as
         desirable

        -   Probably will be impact on click-through rates

        -   Any time there is additional friction that reduces
         click-through / sign-up rates

        -   Browser share matters

        -   Chrome being dominant browser is lowest friction

        -   When friction increases in Chrome, there will be renewed
         interest in optimizing all sign-in flows on all browsers

    -   Phil

        -   Any other FedCM compatible IDPs other than Google?

    -   Brian

        -   Yes, anecdotally

    -   Sam

        -   Happy to bring in other IdPs that have been evaluating FedCM
         into the CG to discussions

    -   Brian

        -   Nascar Screen is a complex beast

        -   Multiple IdPs / multiple buttons

        -   How to deal with preferencing IdPs / how to preference IdPs

        -   More engagement with multiple IdPs in CG would be very
         helpful

    -   Heather

        -   Higher-Ed has been struggling with that for decades

        -   Current result is SeamlessAccess that was results of
         standardized guidance

            -   The guidance that informed the SeamlessAccess IdP
             Discovery Service:
             [<u>https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-27-2019-ra21</u>](https://www.niso.org/publications/rp-27-2019-ra21)

    -   Sam

        -   Interesting that there are two camps of usage

        -   Some is independent of IdPs

        -   Some would benefit from having Nascar screen pulled out and
         into Browser

        -   Paypal is an example of those who are experimenting with
         FedCM

        -   Achim is also experimenting with some of the IdPs in Germany
         with FedCM too

    -   Ben

        -   FedCM — if an RP migrates to FedCm with Google Identity

        -   And the user visits RP with FF

        -   What happens?

    -   Brian

        -   Will default back to SAA based flow today

        -   Same thing for Safari

        -   Can point to technical docs and demo

        -   Fallback that adds another User Gesture prompt

        -   But that’s not popular as additional gestures lose users

    -   GHeorge

        -   It’s not additional to what Safari’s already doing today,
         right? In terms of gestures

        -   Would fall back add that amount of friction

    -   Sam

        -   It’s a Browser prompt so one more click

    -   George

        -   This already happens in Safari

        -   User prompt first

        -   Then get to IdP page

        -   In Google, there wouldn’t be that browser-based prompt

        -   User goes to site in Safari, they see the prompt

        -   User goes to site in Chrome, they don’t see the prompt

        -   Today

        -   But with 3PCD, the user would see the prompt in both cases,
         right?

        -   Level the playing field?

        -   Don’t want to see (after 3PCD):

        -   Goes to site in Safari and see the prompt

        -   Go to site in Chrome and see 2 or 3 prompts

        -   That would substantially degrade the experience

    -   Sam

        -   It’s the reverse

        -   User would go through fewer prompts than Safari with FedCM

    -   George

        -   If an RP implements standard sign-in without FedCM

        -   If they go to Chrome after 3PCD, what is the user experience

    -   Sam

        -   Exposes both SAA and FedCM APIs

        -   So via SAA they would get the same experience as Safari and
         FF

        -   So GIS uses FedCM because it is a better user experience

    -   Brian

        -   Websites also have another option

        -   They can move all this to the back end

        -   If gesture requirements get too great, they can do that

        -   Those are large, complex have subscription flows

        -   Have multiple methods to sign in depending on which part of
         the website the user is in

        -   So, there is always a breaking point where websites just
         pull out of the front end experience entirely

    -   George

        -   Is that a full-page redirect?

    -   Brian

        -   No — auth is completely on back-end

    -   JohnB

        -   Do they collect 3P credentials?

    -   George

        -   If RP is allowed to take credentials, to do it all on
         back-end, that is disconcerting

    -   Brian

        -   Yes they will use OAuth flow and redirect in that case

    -   Heather

        -   Where are FF and Safari with FedCM?

        -   Apple has not participated much since workshop 2 years ago

        -   But no direct signals on whether Safari will actually
         implement

        -   Safari is indicating No Position on FedCM in a recent repo

        -   Would be good to ping them again

    -   Sam

        -   Based on recent discussions with Safari people (John
         Wilander and Ricky Mondelo / Passkeys)

        -   Directionally speaking FedCM is constructive

        -   Tracking on the web is bad

        -   FedCM also offers a path to remove heuristics to detect
         bounce tracking, etc.

    -   Ben

        -   Thinking an API is directionally correct is different than
         saying spec as designed could be shipped or a
         backwards-compatible version could be shipped

    -   Sam

        -   Agreed — don’t necessarily expect them to implement current
         FedCM

        -   But indications so far are better than feedback other APIs
         have received at this stage

    -   Ben

        -   Just want to make clear where other browsers are.

    -   Sam

        -   Also, Safari has a long list of things they want to work on
         — many more important than FedCM (e.g., Push
         Notifications, etc.)

        -   So, it’s a question of prioritization

        -   As ecosystem demands it, priority will go back up

        -   Catching up on a lot of other APIs to, so priorities make
         sense

-   Next Call

    -   Atlantic call

    -   Achim / Tim will run that

    -   Daylight Savings time

    -   USA March 10th

    -   EU March 31st

    -   Australia has already started to switch

    -   Will cancel March 12th call in view of W3C

    -   March 19th call not sure due to IETF meeting

    -   March 26th — prob cancel due to Heather and Achim not availabl

Brian’s Notes re: [<u>Google Identity rollout of FedCM</u>](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/federated-credential-management-migration-for-google-identity-services.html)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Goal

Move from status quo [<u>to use
FedCM</u>](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/federated-credential-management-migration-for-google-identity-services.html)
with zero negative impact to sign-in for: 1. Users 2. Websites.

Metrics: between &gt;100K and &lt;1.5B 28D active users across 134K
sites. [<u>Authentication technologies market
share</u>](https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/authentication/)

Value to websites: One Tap sign-up and sign-in increases of 2X or more
[<u>Case Studies & Featured
Apps</u>](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/case-studies).

### Status quo

For web apps, Google offers five APIs in two languages for user sign-in
(JWT\~OpenID) and OAuth2 (auth code, access and refresh tokens):

| API Name                            | Language   | Methods | Objects | Properties | Elements | Attributes |
|-------------------------------------|------------|---------|---------|------------|----------|------------|

### Migration methods

-   Use the API abstraction layer to insulate websites from as much
 churn as possible. First, release backward compatible updates to
 Google’s existing JavaScript libraries for Auth, then switch these
 libraries to use FedCM by default. A percentage of requests now
 use FedCM, RPs may elect to use FedCM prior to full migration.

-   Developer guides: [<u>Migrate to
 FedCM</u>](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/fedcm-migration)
 and [<u>Migrate from Google
 Sign-In</u>](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/migration)

-   Developer tools:

    -   [<u>Privacy Sandbox Analysis Tool
     (PSAT)</u>](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/psat-announcement)
     scans page resources for known impacts and displays results in
     a DevTools report similar to Lighthouse and Performance
     insights.

    -   Cookie blocking [<u>Test
     suite</u>](https://gis-example.glitch.me/gis-tests.html) to
     demystify user sessions, cookie blocking behaviors, button and
     widgets.

-   Notify RPs using: Developer Console messages, Google for Developers
 blog, Email, and the Privacy Sandbox

-   Support through the Google Developer Experts program, partnerships,
 and Stack Overflow tags

### Challenges

-   Sign-in and authorization have numerous use cases, sometimes these
 are obscure or difficult to quantify.

-   Websites are diverse. Common building blocks and APIs are used in
 many ways:
 [<u>https://www.hyrumslaw.com/</u>](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/)

-   Websites are not always actively maintained, adopting new changes
 may not be an RP priority. This is a classic case of leading
 without authority.

    -   Deprecation of the GSI sign-in API
     [<u>started</u>](https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/gsi-jsweb-deprecation.html)
     four years ago, usage has decreased by roughly two-thirds.

-   APIs insulate websites from *churn in the codebase*, but FedCM
 affects others areas

    -   User experience: user activation requirements (button click),
     settings to block or allow Federated Auth, and the size,
     position, and branding of prompts

    -   Security and privacy controls: Cross-Origin Isolation: Iframe
     and storage permission policies, Cross-Origin Opener Policy
     (COOP), Content Security Policy (CSP)

Notes on upcoming meeting schedule

-   March 5 call = agenda TBD; Achim and/or Tim to run it

-   *\[March 10 = US DST starts\]*

-   March 12 call = canceled in favor of the W3C breakout day

-   March 19 call = canceled in favor of the IETF meeting (?)

-   March 26 call = Achim and HF unavailable - cancel?

-   *\[March 31 = Europe DST starts\]*

-   April 2 = back to normal, yay!

-   April 8 = Pacific call

-   April 9 = have the Atlantic call anyway since we canceled so much of
 March? Note the conflict with OSW (so we'll lose Sam, Tim, and
 possibly others)

-   April 16 = cancel in favor of IIW
