Notes
=====

-   Convening chatter

    -   Aside, perhaps a FedID working group in person and hybrid,
   perhaps in late June….

    -   Identiverse will have Google sign-in demo

-   Heather

    -   Convening reminders of membership and code of conduct

    -   Conference season! We’ve missed some meetings and have a heavy
   agenda.

    -   Tim in chat FYI, here's the FedCM slides Sam and I used at OSW:
   [<u>https://tcslides.link/osw24-fedcm101</u>](https://tcslides.link/osw24-fedcm101)

    -   Six issues on the list for Google

-   Christian Biesinger lets begin with [<u>Continuing the sign-in flow
 in a popup</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/555) lower
 controversy

    -   This proposal seems generally supported and is mentioned in
   several issues

    -   Achim: good idea to break these things out

    -   Christian Biesinger: Assumes Mozilla will be happy with
   something more IDP controlled

-   Next
 [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/556</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/556)
 Passing custom data to the ID assertion endpoint \#556

    -   CB: notes that this provides an easier way to pass data to IdP
   than nonce and request

    -   CB: The params array may be a useful addition

    -   Phil Smart: inside the params make sense, confirms this is
   optional

    -   Achim: agrees with Phil; using params as a generic mechanism
   makes it easier to map to different protocols;

    -   Confirm in favor of params

    -   Aaron: also supports params, response type fields are more
   protocol bound. Need clarity on where this is — it’s for the
   request to the IdP endpoint — some of the language around the
   use of the terms could be improved so as not to be confused
   with the ID.

    -   Some discussion about how the nonce is used for OpenID

    -   Aaron: keep the top level params, let protocols map

    -   Sam: should nonce move to params? Backwards compatibility
   issues.

    -   CB: Could make nonce optional

    -   Achim: remove every top level thing that isn’t browser required
   and then let the params be the protocol definition space
   \[specifically nonce as a top level thing that is really
   protocol specific\]

    -   Sam: trade off that if everything is in params, it could lead to
   fragmentation in the ecosystem. Not something that browsers
   can take a stand on

    -   Aaron: we really would need to make specific bindings for
   protocols

    -   Sam: open to making anything that increases interoperability

-   [<u>Allow IDPs to use multiple config files within an
 eTLD+1</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/552)

    -   CB: requests that an IdP needs to use different endpoints for
   different session IDs ... several use cases … The current
   design is so you can’t encode RP information in the URL. The
   accounts endpoint is the only privacy sensitive thing.
   Multiple files OK as long as one accounts endpoint.
   .well-known lists the account's file that is allowed, login
   url — any config file as long as it points to the same

    -   Tim: really needed when there’s different branding. This will be
   valuable.

    -   Alan B: How will this work for IdPs in the
   https://sts.windows.net/ domain?

        -   Tim: This is the token issuer, NOT the actual endpoint URL

        -   Alan: yes, sorry,
       [<u>https://login.microsoftonline.com/</u>](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
       is the endpoint, still an issue for TLD .well-known

    -   CB thinks this is useful, Tim supports branding, another case
   supported — doesn’t address everything but still useful

-   [<u>Allowing IDPs to expose different account lists in different
 contexts</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/553)

    -   CB: Builds upon multiple config files; Idea is that as long as
   the accounts endpoint doesn’t get different parameters; Add a
   field — server sends list of strings for accounts, config file
   gives the labels supported; “account label” filter supports
   limiting accounts to those that meet criteria

    -   Aaron: in many different contexts — it seems we need to have
   groups of IDPs that share context and use case? Would
   different IdPs share labels? An IdP could register itself with
   a label string

    -   Sam: Idp that has more than one account can segment them.
   Namespaced to that one IdP

    -   CB: If a group agrees on one string…

    -   Sam: …let the IdP label be a URL, so browser can ask if part of
   an IdP Federation

    -   Phil: Is label for an account or class of account?

    -   CB: tag accounts “enterprise” or “consumer” for different
   accounts — it’s not passed back to the RP.

    -   &gt;&gt; discussion when this occurs so that information : the
   labels are used so the browser can filter which accounts are
   shown in the account chooser

-   [<u>Suppressing permission prompt in FedCM UI for custom
 scopes</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/559)

    -   CB Mozilla has the strongest opposition to this, Ben is out this
   week.

    -   Sam: is tied into how much OpenID Connect should be at browser

    -   Achim: scope was meant to be a top level attribute, used as a
   segue to browser presenting consent. Semantic of scopes is at
   the protocol level, maybe the less controversial would be
   whether …. is shown

    -   Basically, add scopes parameter, so that on a request for
   additional scopes, the browser won’t show the consent, the IdP
   a continue on URL, and that then passes the user to the
   browser to ostensibly ask for consent.

    -   Sam: we need to find a way to skip the consent when the IdP
   needs more control over what is released (e.g., different IdPs
   share more, less— the baked in “standard claims” aren’t so
   standard.

        -   How do we support RPs asking for a different set of claims
       about the user?

    -   CB: config file boolean

    -   Sam: can’t be in the config file

    -   CB: offer different config files

    -   Sam: is this the same val

    -   Alan: For most contractual arrangements there will be agreed
   scopes/claims (or SAML2 attributes) being requested and
   released. Certainly having this second permission is confusing
   for that. Seems to be for only ad-hoc IdP choosing — e.g.,
   using google to log in to some new service offering OpenID
   options

        -   This sounds much more like consumer/social arrangements not
       business/enterprise/higher-ed arrangements

        -   It is GOOD to have something to control the consent screen,
       but the request is something else

    -   Aaron: this should be a boolean over “show or don’t show”
   consent

    -   Sam: If there’s a way to request a subset how does this interop

    -   Aaron: keep it simple

    -   Sam: In the future we expect that IdPs will want to ask
   different consent rules — because now hard coded “do you want
   to share name, email, profile?”

    -   Aaron: better to address the specific browser behavior than the
   protocol

    -   CB: Time box

-   [<u>A not-yet logged in IDP has no route to success with this
 flow</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/442)

    -   We talked about this flow a while back…. “Continue with IdP
   button” we call this the “button flow” Chrome running origin
   trial for desktops starting with 125

    -   Feature detection — originally we had a temporary workaround.
   Reuse WebAuthn Level 3 implementation so can request whether a
   browser supports … different credential types can do their own
   thing.

    -   Tim: thinks this belongs in the original spec. Needs privacy
   review; it’s silent.

    -   Haven’t had Chrome security review

    -   Tim: the option to not support vs not acknowledge — need to
   review a previous discussion — Tim will send link

Heather providing debrief on Working group and IIW — see the link for
notes — should get before it goes away as part of the proceeding
publication

Active discussion on whether to update the Federated Identity WG to
include credentials. Strong opinions For and Against — see the link in
the notes. The WG is considering a Face-To-Face (F2F) at the end of
June. Weeks of progress were made during IIW.

As the Working Group kicks off, ***the IPR arrangements are
different.*** The WG is picking up FedCM and will be under a different
IP arrangement. While CG can discuss and incubate, some differentiation
of topics will occur
