Notes
=====

-   Sam: FedCM

    -   FedCM is part of the larger Privacy Sandbox effort coordinating
      with other efforts and creating new API’s

    -   Q3 2022 all chrome APIs to be in general availability (in chrome
      stable)

    -   FedCM specifically is in origin trials today (starting in M101)
      lasting a quarter

    -   Starting Android implementation, desktop will come out in next
      milestone and be available for month or so.

    -   Still collecting feedback from the ecosystem

    -   Working with Firefox to understand what the API should be and
      what are the issues

    -   Working with Devs supporting origin trials to communicate how to
      use API and what’s missing

    -   Got a good number of use cases they expect FedCM to be
      constructed for

        -   Social login (login buttons/widgets)

        -   Restructuring with view community (SAML IDPs) for front
  channel logout

        -   Deployment is different because thousands of IDPs

        -   Subscription managers: products that unlock content for
  users (like an aggregator) ex: student gets access to
  paper or unlock publications

            -   Finding the analogy of “logging in” not tracking 1 to 1

            -   This isn’t the same as logging in to site, just prove
      someone has rights to a piece of content, not
      necessarily what their identity is

            -   Enterprise applications for front channel logout

            -   Use cases that are more Oauth than OpenID

            -   Access to users google calendar

    -   Heather has been the expert/educator in this role so much of the
      context pulled from her.

    -   Feedback was positive enough that browser vendors were
      positively aligned

    -   Other vendors interested in seeing how vendors positively help
      them

    -   Some 1st party federations (in absence of 1st party sets) think
      FedCM could play a role

    -   Plenty of feedback from Dick Heart explaining how the API is
      useful but limited

    -   Firefox also explained limitations in roll out especially for
      timing

    -   Ideal if we could make PPOR for malaysian

    -   Identified that it’s useful enough and can be used for
      incremental launches

    -   Things we want to change:

        -   Planned to start by overloading Federated credential but
  accidentally limited backwards compatibility

        -   Learned large use of federated credentials (pivot to other
  types)

        -   Don’t think of self as federated identity providers or as
  part of site login

        -   Can’t pick webID (already taken)

        -   Working with Tim Berners Lee’s group

    -   From Jason: did feedback affect timelines on FedCM

    -   Reply from Sam: may have impact on 1st party sets but not FedCM

    -   Designed to be independent of 1st party sets (ship fedCM without
      1st party sets)

    -   From Jason: would 3rd party depreciation happen with 1st party
      sets

    -   Sam: Q2 2023 is chrome phasing out 1st party cookies

    -   Tim: they are paired in the approach

    -   FedCM is backup for FCS

    -   FedCm is designed so it won’t only work with specific browsers

    -   Tim: need to tweak messaging to accommodate it is a broad
      message

    -   Sam: there is a [<u>github
      issues</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/41#issuecomment-790989271)
      to help with naming (Can’t go back to WebID, but trying Web ID
      API)

    -   Tim: Naming could be a good agenda item for future meeting

    -   Sam: We have a version of this discussion in internal form
      working with Web Authen folks, and trying to find a framing
      option.

    -   Overall problems: Clarify relationship between FedCM, WebID, Web
      Authen

    -   Use Cases that don’t look like login

    -   Still in framing exercise now, got validation over applicability
      of API, finding novel cases but also vendors with more formal
      signals for vendors

    -   Next step is intent to ship to package feedback and launch API

    -   Aiming to get this out in Q3 (no need to deviate from original
      timeframe)

    -   George: There are tons of other IDP controlled flows that IDP
      needs to be able to manage UX for. May take Identifier first
      kind of flow but if user hits risk determination may need to
      take additional action. Need the mechanism that says if a
      streamlined thing doesn’t work, give control to IDP. Where ID
      is going is a personalized ID experience (per
      user/device/transaction)

    -   Sam: That makes sense with what we are planning to do. For Hello
      for example, Hello offers ability to pick name/email/etc from
      multiple sources. Want to see how to use IDP controlled Ui to
      limit UX with user.

    -   George: User enters Username, IDP gives wallet context
      (QR/FIDO/Etc) and you wanna choose context based on ID
      provided. There are many different flavors of login flows. If
      RP says something to IDP. what that entails changes on a
      transactional basis. In cases where user already logged in,
      for login flows it’s not clear how the API works

    -   Tim: Proposing new W3C working group for wallet (no IDP in
      consumer sense) and consumer federation goes away and replaced
      with wallet and pass key. Pass a verifiable credentials and
      wrap it in vanity API that results in a passkey stored by
      server

    -   Geroge: In this case, sae party fed/1st party SSO, have cases
      where users must be directed to get into the IDP. login
      experience not fixed for user. Need User to get to IDP where
      IDP controls experience based on code i provide (maybe through
      interstitial). The user is already logged in at IDP and we
      wanna do SSO, very doable. But if user needs to login this
      gets more complicated.

    -   Sam: Interest for once user is logged in, help user manage
      session with short lived credentials. More concrete we can
      make the file, the better. The more we deprecate 3rd party
      cookies the worse it is.

    -   So many unknowns and moving parts (for instance bounce tracking)
      is constructive to look at 3rd party cookie in isolation as
      constructive way to narrow discussion.

    -   Much of these we develop, when we have a concrete partner we can
      work with and has product running in prod, we are able to
      collab and not have to solve these problems by ourselves. Find
      partners with capability and interest to work with us toward
      common solution

  table</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/wiki/Third-party-cookie-mitigations)

    -   PrivacyCG: the Login Status API discussions about should come to
      this group as a work item. They are trying to get membership
      to the FedID CG, so hopefully we’ll be able to get them in
      here.

    -   Good productive

    -   Sam:

        -   We generally think that the Login Status API isn’t something
  that chrome can use as is (because its intended use isn’t
  yet determined, which changes how you calculate the abuse
  vectors), but we do believe that there is something in
  there that is going to be useful.

        -   Specifically, we think that there are concrete ways that the
  browser knowing that the user is logged in to a website
  can be helpful.

        -   Session management always comes up, with regards to cookie
  theft. So, binding things to the device, through things
  like TPMs, I think is going to be useful for the browser
  to help.
