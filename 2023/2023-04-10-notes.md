Notes
=====

-   Cameron: quick recap on timing attack issue:

    -   Users need to select IdP before IdP is contacted – explicitly
 link RP to IdP

    -   Want to collect linkage and facilitate future interactions

    -   Mozilla not jazzed about Google wanting to make this as close to
 one-click or no-clicks as possible → conflict on design
 desires

        -   Mozilla: ok w/ users having to be deliberate in choosing to
     login, want to minimize opportunities to leak info w/o
     user input

        -   Don’t want Chrome to go “simplified” way – want parity
     between browsers, muddy landscape

        -   General stance: always prompt user, even if that adds
     friction in UX. If don’t prompt user, there can be ways
     for RPs/IdPs to colllude and push through “quiet”
     interactions

-   Cameron: recap on CORS issue:

    -   Sites should be able to establish what are protected resources

    -   Example: for someone to access idp token, need to provide auth
 cookie; firefox does tcp where specific 1st/3rd party cookies
 are limited to cookie jars. If IdP doesn’t check
 sec-fetch-dest header, could bleed info. Safari blocks these
 cookies, Firefox partitions them.

    -   How does PKCE work on back-channel flow, and how that might
 release info

    -   Judith: token should be opaque.

    -   Cameron: sec-fetch-dest api only problem if don’t have a way of
 partitioning cookies

    -   Cameron: want Chrome to partition cookies, so we have parity
 across browsers

        -   Need more discussion around login status api to be more
     agnostic, esp. Around CORS

        -   Login status API not mature yet – not clear solution to
     problem

    -   Vittorio: would be good if sign-in status API and fedcm API were
 under one umbrella.

    -   Cameron: Sign-in status api could be used to filter IdPs, to
 present ones that you are more likely to use, have used in
 past

    -   Heather will follow-up w/ Sam

-   Cameron: Sign-in status API: specific browsers might push SSO that
 larger org prioritizes; if site is detecting which login method
 you’re using, could lead to “arms race” for specific browsers that
 promote specific login methods – which could expose data w/o users
 being aware – users might be pushed to use a specific browser due
 to login method, even though that method may be less
 secure/leaking info

-   Heather: where we stand w/ Hackathon proposals:

    -   Judith: 2 branches made (1 for each proposal); markdown
 submitted for each one – should allow for more targeted
 discussion about parts of each proposal. Entered in as
 branches about an hour ago.

        -   [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/blob/Offloading-Trust-Issue-5/offloading-trust.md</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/blob/Offloading-Trust-Issue-5/offloading-trust.md)

        -   [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/blob/idp-sp-storage-API-Issue-4/idp-sp-storage-api.md</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/blob/idp-sp-storage-API-Issue-4/idp-sp-storage-api.md)

    -   Judith: we had discussed who would be attending IIW – Chris
 Philips won’t be attending

    -   Heather: did REFEDS browser changes working group indicate who
 would be attending? Might need to register to be allowed
 on-site

    -   Tim Cappalli: can use walk-up guest lists

    -   Judith: Handful of people from I2; Mark Rank from Cirrus

    -   Heather: we have a handful of challenges, e.g. proxy component –
 will discuss next week

    -   Judith: is Microsoft meeting under W3C terms? Tim: can be under
 whatever terms we want

    -   Heather: info needs to come back into open
