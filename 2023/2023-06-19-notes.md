Notes
=====

-   Draft WG Charter:

    -   Heather added an introduction from community group charter

    -   She suggested a scope change based on past discussion

    -   She also added to the coordination section to describe
     interactions with community group, akin to private advertising
     WG/CG

    -   Based on feedback from Tim, she will add a background section

    -   Clear deliverables? Includes normative spec; further expansion
     may be difficult at this stage

    -   Tim wants to move this to GitHub by July 15 in order to solicit
     additional feedback on the charter contents from outside teams

    -   Question: Do other groups want to be at that point to be
     explicitly mentioned as CGs that the WG will call out to for
     reviews.

        -   Eg., Privacy CG

        -   PING

    -   Will discuss further and clarify

-   Heather:

    -   Looking at Calendar – prob won’t have anything much more to say
     on this topic for a bit

    -   Will put a note to revisit on Jul 10th to review in FedID CG
     meeting

    -   Jul 17th - tentative date to publish charter in GitHub

-   Tim:

    -   Big issue is the OAuth stuff

    -   Charter is written for Identity Credentials and Oauth scopes
     (Refresh Topics /etc.) is a big expansion on that.

    -   If dealing with OAuth is in-scope, then FedCM would have to go
     into its own WG.

    -   People who are already teetering on verge of not supporting this
     WG will not support if OAuth is in scope

    -   Big question is whether Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens are
     Identity Credentials or not?

-   Achim:

    -   OAuth seems to be a vital feature for FedCM (eg., Calendar
     access)

    -   Could leave OAuth out

    -   But what happens when the APIs need to support broader Auth?

    -   As-is it is authorization for Identity Credentials only? Or
     beyond

-   Herather:

    -   Are those actually distinguishable?

-   Achim:

    -   Technically not so much

    -   Google folks: Are there use cases that leverage a federated
     account but need to authorize

-   Tim:

    -   At a high-level not opposed to FedCM dealing with those, but
     need to know the line about what is in scope for Identity
     Credential vs. other Authorization

-   Achim:

    -   It’s blurry because we would need an Access Token for the
     Identity Credentials already

-   Tim:

    -   Yes - it’s not a technical issue – more about which WG deals
     with what?

    -   Maybe WebAppSec deals with part of it and Web Identity WG deals
     with other parts?

    -   Or maybe an overarching WG with sub-groups and sub-charters
     within?

-   Heather:

    -   Proposal: Next week we focus on that question of Authorization
     (when Sam’s back)

    -   <https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/477>

    -   

    -   Cancel Jul 3rd meting (big US holiday)

    -   Regroup on Jul 10th

-   MikeK

    -   Note Sam’s on vacation first 3 weeks of July

-   Achim:

    -   For mDL and Verifiable Presentation stuff, need additional
     details, need to ensure we define that properly

-   Tim:

    -   Should be covered in existing Goal text, but agree on needing to
     more finely define the Scope

-   Heather:

    -   Higher-ed folks want to set up a test-bed

    -   Call last week to discuss

    -   Notes:

        -   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uh7CYN8-6W5413Vn6-MZQrWNBlpSSnTqkqC-X_8WEV0/edit>

    -   Nothing concrete yet in terms of test bed

    -   Aiming for real basic - installing something on localhost to see
     “did I fundamentally break anything”

    -   Then: external testbed to test more extensive scenarios
     (multiple-IDP / Multi-RP)

    -   Peter Gietz & co. from DAASI (EU Edu) will be participating /
     driving

-   Achim:

    -   Tool suggestion for Debugging Fedcm - <https://proxyman.io/>

        -   Tool to trace what is happening

        -   Only way to know exactly what the Browser is completely
         doing

        -   Also can do local proxy and view data flows

        -   Very useful for debugging / understanding

    -   Esp. now that the API now has a number of various switches /
     scopes to adjust and this allows for more transparent
     experimentation

-   Christian (chat) - chrome://net-export can be helpful

-   wanpeng (chat) - burp can also be used

-   Achim:

    -   Are there any Mozilla builds yet?

-   Heather:

    -   Cameron gave instructions on how to install latest Firefox
     builds with latest debugging

-   Yi:

    -   There is!

        -   Enable
         \`dom.security.credentialmanagement.identity.enabled\`

        -   (on FF nightly builds)

        -   rp demo site: https://wiggly-towering-breath.glitch.me/
