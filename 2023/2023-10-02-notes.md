      - Good progress at TPAC, W3C staff looking forward to helping
    
      - Achim: contentwise in alignment, need final look
    
      - Awaiting TimC on pull request items.
        
          - Pull requests awaiting input feedback

          - Christian
            
              - Presented at
                TPAC[<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/436</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/436)
            
              - We are hoping to get this PR merged in a week or so so
                that we can sen the I2S
            
              - Intent is to ship this in M120, branch cuts in a month
            
              - We’ve been working with Ben V for a while and we
                believe this is generally OK
            
              - Call for last few comments
        
          - Matthew
            
              - How would authentication intermediaries use the Login
                Status API when they don’t maintain state
            
              - Every time you go through it you go through an
                authentication flow
        
          - Christian: don’t know if it would work particularly great
            with FedCM generally
            
              - Would rely on a new yet-to-exist API addition that
                would assist with this
        
          - Heather: these are the proxy intermediaries, Matt confirms
            yes
            
              - No 3rd party cookies needed? Matt correct.
        
          - Matt: no problems with 3rd part cookies being disable (and
            it’s a SAML flow).. So does FedCM really play a role here?
        
          - Sam: If everything is working fine without 3P cookies,
            then it should not need FedCM
        
          - Christian: doesn’t sound like FedCM fits this use case
            (intermediaries)
        
          - Out of scope on link decoration(Matt?
        
          - Sam: not there yet, working on building blocks on this -
            but right now FedCM is not a replacement for Link
            Decoration restrictions
            
              - Link Decoration right now is in experimentation phase
                across all browsers – lots of heuristics being put in
                place
            
              - For example Chrome has Pop-Up (and Redirect)
                Heuristics that are being put in place to mitigate
                Link Decoration restrictions for these types of
                use-cases (and Firefox is also has some similar things
                / heuristics)
        
          - Chris: Seems like conversation is that this isn’t a great
            fit for all use-cases
            
              - If the user is logged-in then the concern is a state
                mismatch between browser’s logged-in state and the
                intermediaries’ notion of the user’s logged-in state
            
              - Might end up with user-confusion in the field in cases
                where there are intermediaries involved
        
          - Matthew:
            
              - Also scenario where there are multiple IDPs behind
                intermediary
            
              - Step-up authentication is an example
            
              - Where primary IDP doesn’t implement MFA, but there is
                another IDP that the intermediary can contact to do
                the MFA step-up if necessary
            
              - So the user isn’t signed in to just one place - they
                are signed into 3 places (intermediary / primary IDP /
                secondary step-up MFA IDP)
            
              - So where would Sign-In status API indicate where you
                are signed in
        
          - Christian:
            
              - This is n’t just sign-in status
            
              - As far as the browser is concerned you are signed into
                the intermediary
            
              - Seems like this should be discussed as a separate
                issue
            
              - File a separate issue int he FedCM Repo
        
          - Sam:
            
              - Was going to suggest that too
            
              - We acknowledge that issue and we’ve been working on
                that with the SAML community for a while
            
              - Hosted two workshops on this already with SAML
                community
            
              - Still work ongoing
            
              - Definitely want to mitigate this scenario when 3P
                cookies go away
            
              - From sequencing perspective will go forward with this
        
          - Chris:
            
              - Will M120 Chrome release be characteristic of
                behavior?
        
          - Christian:
            
              - Expecting the user to sign into the IDP and they won’t
                necessarily have an account list yet
            
              - Button flow (upcoming) will help this to allow
                bootstrapping if user is not logged in to IDP yet
        
          - Sam:
            
              - For SAML would desire an unpersonalized prompt to
                start with (in the case where there aren’t any
                accounts known to the browser yet)
            
              - Proposal that we came up with IIW and SAML group 6
                months ago still seems like it would be ok for this
                scenario
            
              - The Accounts that are available are also dependent on
                the particular RP that the user is trying to sign into
        
          - Chris:
            
              - Proposal is to position this as supporting
                intermediaries in FedCM
            
              - (CP: I think this may already have verbiage in the
                proposed charter itself.. Need to check what the pull
                requests and merges)
        
          - Sam:
            
              - Yes
            
              - ANd proxies as a whole haven’t been dealt with
        
          - Heather:
            
              - Proxies were discussed but decided it was a road too
                far at the moment
            
              - Instead solve for simpler use-cases first and then
                progressively enhance and extend (eg., with additional
                prompts / flows)

          - Christian:
            
              - Question on whether he can review PR in a week or so?
            
              - Ben: Yes, should be ok
            
              - If not would it be ok for us to merge and then update
            
              - Ben: Not sure what the changes were from TPAC

                to you (Ben)

              - Branch cut (for Chrome M120) si Oct 31st so we’d like
                to send I2S somewhere around 2nd week of October
            
              - Would like to get Ben’s take on this around then,
                ideally

        sign-in is failed -
        [<u>fedidcg/FedCM\#488</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/488)
        
          - Yi Gu:
            
              - \<see fedCM 488 for more details\>
        
          - Possible that when user clicks that button they won’t get
            a token at all
        
          - VArious reasons why IDP may not end up actually providing
            a token
        
          - Currently FedCM fails silently in that case
        
          - Instead we’d like to provide an Error API to provide user
            with notification / visibility into what’s happened
        
          - And maybe optionally allow user to log in as well or take
            remedial actions
        
          - We have an error from OAuth perspective from IDP
        
          - So take those error responses and integrate into the UI
        
          - Can show the specific error to users
        
          - Hard to provide a lot of specific details in that simple
            UI
        
          - OAuth 2.0 also has an Error URL in addition to Error Codes
        
          - So, adding an affordance to allow the user to click on
            “More Info” to access that Error URL to get more details
            on the error and perhaps more information on next steps
            they could do to fix it.
        
          - Currently we only accept token and error string
        
          - This would extend response with an explicit Error Code and
            also Error URL
        
          - Some Feedback: Why don’t we just let the IDP handle the
            error themselves
        
          - The IDP \*could\* inject the error code inside the “token”
            that is returned
        
          - And then API caller could parse that token and render the
            error themselves
        
          - Technically that is a solution.
        
          - But it doesn’t feel right to overload the ID Token in that
            way
        
          - In addition such an overloaded ID Token may have other
            issues
        
          - The Browser-provided sign-in UI is consistent, but the
            error presentation would be IDP or RP specific and
            therefore could be inconsistent with browser sign-in UI
        
          - Also, burden would then be on RP to parse and process the
            error embedded inside the returned ID Token
        
          - Also no guarantee that the RP would even render the
            returned error, so no guarantee that errors would end up
            being seen by users
        
          - So, that’s why the proposal is for the browser to present
            errors
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
          - Achim:
            
              - This is intended to return from the ID Assertion
                endpoint?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - Yes
        
          - Achim:
            
              - Would this be better be handled by the
                already-discussed continue-on system
            
              - Where there would just be a pop-up with IDP-provided
                UI
        
          - Yi:
            
              - Proposal is for the IDP to respond with continue-on
                URLinstead of Error Code in this case
        
          - Achim
            
              - Yes - they may be multiple reasons for the IDP to want
                to interact with the user
            
              - Part of which could be Error handling, but could also
                be legit use cases like step-up authentication / MFA /
                Passkeys?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - If IDP did this and replace error code with
                continue-on URL
            
              - Browser doesn’t know if it is due to an error or an
                AuthZ type of flow
            
              - And not sure if there actually is a continuation in
                the particular flow
            
              - In the case of some errors there may not actually be a
                continue-on URL
        
          - Achim:
            
              - IDP would most likely just want to converse with the
                user themselves
            
              - If we wanted a fallback option in the case where the
                IDP didn’t want to do that, that would be fine
        
          - Sam:
            
              - So it doesn’t sound like this is mutually exclusive –
                we’re planning on doing both (Continue-On Pop-Up AND
                Error Code / Error URL Pop-Up APIs)
        
          - Achim:
            
              - Yes
        
          - Sam:
            
              - Initial Error UI is a “less loud” UI / dialog
            
              - Whereas Continue-UI is louder and more abrupt / modal
            
              - Some errors are likely to be quiet enough where we
                wouldn\[‘t want to need a big, modal pop-up window
        
          - Yi:
            
              - This would also be involving a user gesture
        
          - Matthew (asides):
            
              - Don't authentication protocols already have error
                signaling built in?
            
              - Is the assumption that an IdP will return an HTTP
                error code should authentication (or authorization)
                fail?
        
          - Wanpeng
            
              - If an error is returned there is sometime also a code
            
              - So if RPs are not implementing it completely then
                maybe developers could mis-construe error returns for
                successful returns
            
              - Involves the “code” being returned to RP
            
              - RP might not be checking it correctly
            
              - Maybe call it “error code” not just “code”
        
          - Yi:
            
              - It is called “Error Object”
        
          - Wanpeng
            
              - If it was explicitly called “Error Code” or something
                like that it would be more obvious / less prone to
                mis-interpretation
            
              - Esp. for RPs who are pressed for time and may not have
                read the instructions / documentation correctly
            
              - Suggest that the word “code” is not used – use a
                different name instead
        
          - Achim:
            
              - Given that this is post-mediation
            
              - This is mostly pass-through, right?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - Yes - whatever the IDP sends to RP is fine / no
                privacy concerns as it is post-user-consent
            
              - Same questions rom Ben
            
              - We aim to ship this in M120 as well
            
              - Waiting for Spec PR responses as well
        
          - Ben:
            
              - Definitely on the radar
            
              - Just haven’t gotten to it yet
        
          - Yi:
            
              - Does this make sense from a high level? Any major
                objections?
        
          - Ben:
            
              - Generally looks reasonable
            
              - Using OAuth error codes is maybe a bit weird
            
              - But continues to extend the set of OAuthn things that
                are being re-invented in the Browser / API bloat
                concerns
    
      - Feature request: provide developers more visibility of auto
        re-authentication -
        [<u>fedidcg/FedCM\#497</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/497)
        
          - Yi:
            
              - SImpler compared to Error
            
              - Today use credential management
            
              - Optional is the default
            
              - Can explicitly grant permission
            
              - And then on next visit assuming you haven’t logged out
            
              - If cookie is expired - Browser will try auto-re
                authentication process
            
              - Will skip User Consent part
            
              - Only happens if there is only one account available
                for sign-in attempt
            
              - Will send that account to IDP and see if we can get a
                new ID token from IDP
            
              - But – RP doesn’t know if the returned flow is due to
                auto re0-authn vs. explicit / manual (eg., first-time)
                authentication
            
              - Some RPs always want to enforce that user has
                explicitly selected their account manually every time
                (no auto-re-authn)
            
              - If they don’t specify Mediation option or specifiy
                “mediation: optional” they wouldn’t know which
                method was used (manual vs. auto re-authn)
            
              - So this extends token request to the IDP with an
                additional bit to inform IDP whether the request is
                manual vs. auto re-authn initiated
            
              - Also, the browser will extend the response given back
                to the caller with the same type of indication of
                whether it was due to manual vs. auto re-authn
        
          - Achim:
            
              - Yes - sharing the flag with the IDP si totally
                meaningful
            
              - Only meaningful in conjunction with continue-on
            
              - For RP side - that is handled in protocols today so
                not sure if it actually needs an extra piece of info
        
          - Wanpeng:
            
              - Some cases could create cross site request forgery?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - This is for Auto Reauthn so nothing new here
        
          - Wanpeng
            
              - There is some user actions happening?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - In Mediation: REquired case will always show UI
            
              - Otherwise not necessarily
        
          - Wanpeng
            
              - Is this user-controlled or controlled by RP and IDP?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - Today we don't’ have any controls to allow users to
                opt-out of Auto-Reauthn
            
              - Discussion has happened about whether we should do
                this?
        
          - Wanpeng:
            
              - So it is IDP’s choice on this?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - It\[s actually the RP’s choice in the “mediation”
                field in the request?
        
          - Wanpeng:
            
              - EWhy is it RP’s choice?
            
              - Seems like it should be IDP’s choice
            
              - Eg., Apple currently asking for all users to do
                explicit Auth every time
        
          - Yi:
            
              - With this proposal has this control
        
          - Wanpeng:
            
              - If “mediation” is not specified it is off?
        
          - Yi:
            
              - No, it is still on – because “mediation: optional” is
                the default so it will still show Auto Re-Authn
