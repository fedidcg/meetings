Notes
=====

-   IIW Conversations (week before last)

    -   (see link above for notes)

    -   Heather: Sam and Heather are in progress of turning those notes
     / results of meetings into more actionable items

-   FedCM issues

    -   Iframe issue (\#449)

    -   Yi:

        -   (presenting the link to the issue)

        -   As we develop iframe - learned that some sites (eg ebay.com
         uses ebaystatic.com iframe for actual logins)

        -   Problem is that showing all those domains (ebay.com /
         ebaystatic.com / Google.com) could be confusing to users

        -   Ebaystatic.com is generally superfluous to users and would
         confuse them since they are effectively signing into ebay,
         not ebaystatic

        -   HOwever, on some other sites (eg., travel websites) have
         booking widgets that are also in iframes but are not
         associated with the top-level travel site, then if you
         omitted the iframe’s domain that would be inaccurate

        -   So in those cases it makes sense to show all 3 domains in
         the FedCM UI

        -   But: hard to distinguish between these two types of
         situations

        -   So (proposal): Idea of matched clients

        -   If an RP registers with IDP it will have an identifier (eg.,
         client-id)

        -   If an RP has two origins (eg ebay / ebaystatic) those will
         be the same IDP identifier, but

        -   New field Top-Frame origin –

        -   Send that to IDP and compare that to the RP iframe that is
         being sent

        -   FedCM requests will now include top-level origin

        -   And then IDP can tell if the top-level origin if it is the
         same RP (same IDP identifier) or not and return a boolean

        -   And then we can omit the iframe origin in the FedCM UI if
         the top-level and iframe have the same IDP identifier
         (ie., they are the same RP)

        -   If they are different RPs (like in the travel example) then
         show all 3 origins in the FedCM UI

    -   Kris:

        -   The problem also occurs in other situations

        -   Which is why the 1st party set was proposed

        -   Have we discussed that too?

        -   Don’t want one answer for FedCM and other answer for other
         cases

        -   Know that 1st Party sets are frowned upon in general

        -   Don’t want disjointed solutions

    -   Yi:

        -   Top frame and iframe don’t need to be same party or same
         client

    -   Kris:

        -   Could ebay say that ebaystatic is its same party?

        -   As opposed to relying on the IDP to say that

        -   We have one very big challenge that seem to be coming up
         with very use-case specific solutions

    -   Vittorio:

        -   1st party set job (domain level)

        -   Ok to use c lenient id as heuristic

        -   But might be have violation

        -   Using client-id is not always about the way that sign-ins
         really work

        -   If we stay in OpenID realm (client-ids)

        -   If we publish using client-ids as THE way to disambiguate
         then there might be a problem

    -   Yi:

        -   We don’t propose to use client-id, per se,

        -   Instead it is a Client, so we allow IDPs to use whatever
         mechanism they want and just return a boolean

        -   Top iframe could be cross-parties but still 1st party sets

    -   Vittorio:

        -   Good to know that is not client-id specifically

        -   If so, then avoid mentioning ‘client-id’ in the actual text
         of the spec

        -   Instead make it explicit that we can use whatever correlator
         is appropriate

    -   Yi:

        -   Will rephrase in the Spec

        -   To Cameron: Have you looked at this in the past?

    -   Cameron:

        -   No - first encounter to this problem

    -   Yi:

        -   Not sure how FF is going to show iframe domains?

        -   Totally optional - browsers don’t have to do this - browsers
         can show whatever domains they want

    -   Cameron:

        -   Expectation is that we will (going off existing FedCM UI)

        -   There actual URL and shortened URL (via alias)

        -   Looks kind of similar to screenshots in proposal

        -   But needs more thinkinging (from FF perspective)

    -   Sam:

        -   Thanks for suggestion of 1st party sets

        -   Take AI to perhaps chat with 1st Party Set people to explore
         potential synergies

        -   Cameron: Maybe ruled out 1st party sets to avoid dependency
         of FedCVM on 1ast party sets?

        -   But this might be a UX optimization for 1st Party Sets

    -   Cameron:

        -   What is the amount of linkage in 1st Party Sets

        -   Allow one org to share a ton of resources that the user
         might not realize that that sharing is happening

        -   Could be trepidatious for FF

        -   Need to think about this more in context for FedCM

    -   SamP

        -   Take AI to further explore 1st Party Sets area

    -   Yi:

        -   Top level iframe may not be same party as iframe

    -   Kris:

        -   1st party sets can work totally with in iframe domain

    -   [<u>Rick Byers</u>](mailto:rbyers@google.com):

        -   Privacy sandbox input on 1PS

        -   Different problems

        -   In Ebay case they use ebaystatic because they don’t trust
         Google

        -   Want to load Google into a separate domain to NOT share info
         with Google

        -   We don’t want to cause additional info sharing

        -   Debate on whether we want to show the iframe domain in the
         UI

        -   In the end added it as an additional layer to increase
         security

        -   But in these cases we want to avoid it

        -   But don’t want t6o couple this with mechanism increase data
         sharing

    -   Kris

        -   Salesforce has been heavily pro 1SP

        -   Have a ton of domains

        -   Similar to ebay situation

        -   1PS doesn’t automatically plug into this scenario

        -   But similar

        -   Would be good to have a more cohesive solution

        -   It’s not just 2 domains (ebay / ebaystatic)

        -   Salesforce has LOTS of domains

        -   And want to control which domains share info with other
         domains

        -   Need to be able to control that

        -   But not necessarily a good idea to develop FedCM solution to
         this specific problem

        -   Need to come up with an answ43r that solves this problem
         (both within the same browser AND across browsers)\_

    -   Yi:

        -   Need to do more research

        -   But want resolution on this specific solution

    -   Cameron:

        -   Part of confusion is - at top of iframe that it is ebay

        -   In 1PS you can loop in a lot of things that are not
         communicated

    -   Kris:

        -   It is true that 1PS can loop in other stuff

        -   But trying to limit how much

        -   More about the group owner (ebay / Salesforce) to be able
         t6o handle the UI

        -   If it is ebastatic.com - then Ebay can say “this is really
         Ebay.com”

        -   Avoid having to educate users about that linkage

        -   And also specify that ebay and ebaystatic are allowed to
         communicate / share info (as opposed to other domains
         which might not be

    -   Cameron:

        -   How does this work in R&E space?

    -   Yi:

        -   Up to RP / IDP – if not certain always show 3 domains

        -   Also - AFAwe know in FF no way to know top-level domains
         from iframe

        -   FF doesn’t implement ancestor origins

        -   Iframe must be granted permission from embedders to be able
         to learn ancestor domains (in Chrome)

    -   Chris:

        -   (from chat) From my perspective it doesn’t feel like R&E
         deviates from the ‘let’s solve it one way across browsers’
         suggestion Kris is advocating.

    -   Rick:

        -   (From chat) Context:
         [<u>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/ancestorOrigins</u>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/ancestorOrigins)

    -   

    -   [<u>Returning users have to unnecessarily re-approve
     \#429</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/429)

    -   Yi:

        -   Not a new issue

        -   Credential Management API has existing notion of Mediation
         Requirements

        -   Whenever mediation is set to “required” - show UI

        -   Whenever mediation is set to “silent” Browser should try to
         resolve silently (without asking user for explicit
         permissions)

            -   If there is a single returning credential, try to
             re-authenticate automatically

        -   FedCM is in the process of honoring this behavior

        -   Doesn’t compromise Security, as it only auto-re
         authenticates identities that the user has previously
         granted permission for (and have logged into the RP using)

        -   Wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel for FedCM, since this
         concept already exists in Credential Management API

        -   

        -   One more question: Because today FedCM doesn’t implement
         mediation required, it currently effectively hard-codes
         “required”

        -   But CredMan default is “optional” so FedCM’s default
         behavior would change subtly to honor this default

    -   Chris:

        -   Sounds like the “remember me” proposal

        -   Persisting info about things

        -   Already have this in the R&E side of things (remembering
         persistent state)

        -   Sounds similar, but will have to read it further

    -   Yi:

        -   Yes, similar – in CredMan, it would be better if Browser
         could ask some sort of “remember me” question to allow the
         user to indicate that Browser should do this in the
         further (re-authenticate using this identity)

    -   Chris:

        -   So, are these the same or different?

    -   Yi:

        -   Generally the same

        -   But Browser UI is not spec’d

    -   Chris:

        -   When user comes to an IDP that they have used before want to
         persist info about that relationship

        -   Will read more

    -   Cameron:

        -   Becomes optional based on browser’s preferences

        -   Chrome is doing this

        -   What are the expectations for reset vs. “keeping ball
         rolling”

        -   Note that decisions are based on browsers’ knowledge of what
         the user has done //

    -   Yi:

        -   Bunch of conditions

        -   Is there a single credential saved in browser? And only one?
         And have signed up using that credential in the past? And
         the user has not cleared browser history or cookies or
         storage? Any of those clearings would clear this bit and
         make that No Longer a Returning Users and would trigger
         the main FedCM UI (and NOT auto-re-authenticate)

    -   Cameron:

        -   That was the main part of confusion:

            -   Clearing history vs. Clearing just this choice

        -   Is there a situation where the user might want everything
         cleared up but it doesn’t clear this out?

    -   Yi:

        -   No – if anything related is cleared, then this is cleared
         too

    -   Cameron:

        -   FF wants to be more privacy centric but not vastly different
         from other browsers

    -   Rick:

        -   Want to allow flexibility among browsers

        -   Don’t want the browser to enable LESS consent than the
         user’s intent

        -   But want to define the user’s minimum, the browser’s minimum

    -   Cameron:

        -   Want the user’s choice is honored and the browser is
         honoring the user’s choice over IDP choice4

    -   Rick:

        -   Generally agree, except IDP might have their own threat
         model –= don’t want to override that

        -   So: The most conservative choice wins (user / browser / IDP)

    -   Chris:

        -   The phrase “remember me” is “still logged in”

        -   If at a home / public machine – does that present a UI /
         privacy bleed-out?

    -   Yi:

        -   In case where other people can access computer – requires
         that your IDP session is still alive

        -   If you sign out of your IDP, then no longer available

    -   Chris:

        -   Some people have ensign-=in sessions that are days long

    -   Cameron:

        -   Can;’t have simultaneity

        -   Assume logged into Reddit in session

        -   Also can’t be logged into person’s profile and parent’s
         profile

        -   Have to sign out from RP

    -   Yi:

        -   If sign out from RP then there’s a “preventSilentAccess” bit
         that gets set, which prevents Re-Authentication

    -   Chris:

        -   Chrome allows several profiles to be used “simultaneously”

    -   Yi:

        -   Chrome’s permissions are stored per-profile

    -   Cameron:

        -   If I sign out of a profile on Chrome

        -   Can have work and personal open at the same time

        -   If I sign out of personal with Google that should break the
         linkage

    -   Yi:

        -   If you sign out of IDP it signs out of all accounts

    -   

    -   [<u>Do not use setTimeout directly
     \#389</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/389)

    -   Christian Biesinger:

        -   Currently spec say that after 60 seconds from API call,
         rejected the promise sith a network error

        -   Thinking to remove that

        -   Aligns better with FF

        -   Also no longer matches what Chrome now implements

        -   Instead - PR replaces it with: Whenever an error occurs,
         rejected Promise after a random delay

        -   Reason for random delay is so that RP cannot learn whether
         the user has an account on the IDP or not

        -   With random delay disallows RP to distinguish between user
         canceling dialog and lack of accounts on the IDP

    -   Phil Smart:

        -   (question about differences between errors and lack of
         accounts)

    -   Christian:

        -   If IDP does not send back any accounts, then there are no
         accounts to show in the Account Chooser

        -   But don’t want to leak that info to the

    -   Chris: Randomness range?

    -   Christian:

        -   Cannot do in ms range – needs to be indistinguishable from
         user input

        -   So 0 to 60 seconds

    -   Chris:

        -   Sometimes when the site is down it never renders anything

        -   If you have multiple IDPs and one is the bad in the bunch

        -   Nothing was rendered at all

        -   So, +1 to having a timeout

        -   But 60s is “an aeon” in Internet time (to wait)

    -   Nicolas:

        -   For Multi-IDP point: Good Question

        -   Did think about case where IDP doesn’t reply

        -   With Multi-IIDP we’d bundle multiple IDPs in the same UI

        -   But would need responses from all IDPs by the deadline

        -   How to ensure UI for the working IDPs

        -   Not in spec yet

        -   But would like ideas to mitigate

        -   Spec has a timer as a deadline – show whatever IDP responses
         gathered by the timeout

        -   But that is slightly separate from PR issue

        -   How to ensure IDP does not distinguish between 2 cases:

            -   User rejects FedCM dialog

            -   No accounts from IDP

    -   Phil

        -   (from chat) Personally, would not use the semantic of
         ‘rejection’ if it has no accounts. Because it maybe
         replying with no-active sessions, not a rejection, just no
         active security contexts.

            -   Was answered (my bad). It is the JS ‘rejection’ of the
             promise. Not the IdP ‘rejecting’ the account request.

    -   Sam:

        -   Yi: Implementation status?

        -   Iframe in Chrome Canaries

        -   Reauthn is Origin Trials?

    -   Yi:

        -   Reauthn (original version) is in Origin Trial

        -   Plan to ship in M115

        -   Iframes domain fix is also being worked on – also planned on
         M115

        -   M115 branch cut is May 23rd – released in July

    -   Sam:

        -   No code changes after branch cut

        -   So NOW is the best time to give us feedback for these two
         features

-   Heather

    -   Next call is a Pacific call

    -   Lots of people in Berlin for conference

    -   Depending on co-chairs’ availability will determine viability of
     next week’s call

    -   Also:

        -   Updating list of Identity-related conferences in 2023

        -   There’s a lot!
