Notes
=====

-   WG Proposal Status

    -   Please note transition process links in the agenda above (cf.
     "General reminder").

    -   Finished advanced review by strategy team

    -   Currently in horizontal review phase by broader audience, with
     feedback on charter in GitHub (also linked above) or received
     via Slack channels

    -   Do [<u>web platform tests</u>](https://web-platform-tests.org/)
     (WPTs) meet the test suite requirement? (NB: WPTs are designed
     to be run by multiple browsers/engines.)

    -   Existing FedCM tests are here:
     [<u>credential-management</u>](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/credential-management)
     (the ones starting with fedcm-\*)

    -   WebDriver tests intended for browser automation are probably not
     what's being referred to in the linked issue, but those are
     good, too.

    -   Both acceptance tests and regression tests are good additions to
     the charter.

    -   WG name is causing some confusion. Do we insist on the current
     name? Will likely receive significant opposition from the
     wider W3C.

    -   Rename WG to match the CG? Other parties worry it will be harder
     to include identity credential work (NB: includes immature
     technologies such as digital wallets, verifiable credentials)
     after that leaves incubation.

    -   Renaming during rechartering is OK but could cause worse
     confusion

    -   Question: Stick with "Web Identity Credential" WG name, or
     change to "Federated Identity" matching the CG name?

    -   **Consensus: Change WG name to "Federated Identity" matching the CG name**

-   FedCM Issues—[<u>Not-yet-logged-in
 IdP</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/442)

    -   Prototype built and some validation done

    -   Thanks, Phil! Your demos and videos really help a lot!

    -   Next, drafting a [<u>Chrome experiment for origin
     trials</u>](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/web-platform/origin-trials/)
     (starting 2024 Q1?)

    -   Needs an explainer flow for this issue

    -   Also includes “Add Account”/”Use another account”, [<u>issue
     511</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/511)

    -   Multi-IdP side does not work as expected; work starting soon

-   FedCM Issues—[<u>domain
 hint</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/427)

    -   Corresponding [<u>pull request,
     \#512</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/512)

    -   Which option feels more intuitive/correct?

    -   Domain hints might be easier for devs to follow.

    -   Could be folded into login hints.

    -   Add multiple login hints to login URL?

-   AOB?

    -   Next call is an Atlantic call; following is Pacific.

    -   New Pacific call schedule will go out soon.

    -   Christmas/New Year's calls cancelled
