Notes
=====

-   Update on WG proposal

    -   Did not get to it on Agenda (WICG) in the past meeting

    -   Bumped to next call which should be in next 2 weeks or so

    -   Had hoped for it to be approved by beginning of 2024

-   Allow user agents to use "Connected Accounts Set" with flexibility -
  [<u>issue 517</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/517)

    -   Questions around prototyping

    -   Yi:

        -   Context about issue

        -   Today when user signs into RP with IDP browser treats them
          as new user

        -   User clicks Continue button

        -   Browser remembers that association

        -   Subsequent sign-ins will be treated as Returning User and
          will enable returning user features (like Auto Sign-In)

        -   Ultimate source of truth of returning user is from the IdP

        -   Causes issues when user starts on Browser A but then moves
          to Browser B

        -   Browser B has never observed the user signing in to the RP,
          so treats it as a new user

        -   For Privacy reasons, always want to ensure the user has
          consented to signing into the RP

        -   However there are several mechanisms now that allow the IDP
          to get 3P cookie access on the RP (Privacy Sandbox
          exemptions, Storage Access API, etc.)

        -   So, the browser can use the presence of 3P cookies for the
          IDP as a trust signal to trust the IdP’s indication that
          the user is a returning user

        -   However, even if we trust the IdP’s indication of a
          returning user, the browser doesn’t trust the association
          because the browser has never actually seen the user
          providing consent on that specific browser instance.

        -   So , for example if 3P cookies end up subsequently not being
          available then it will revert back to being a new user,
          which will cause the browser to show the UI again that the
          user will have to provide their consent to (the
          association of which the browser will now remember)

    -   Tim:

        -   Do you see this intersecting with, say , user has accounts
          linked to local platform (windows account manager /
          multiple tenants) do you see this connecting to that in
          the future / to populate this set?

    -   Yi

        -   Interesting – bar is what the API can do with or without the
          API

        -   Make sure Privacy bar is high enough

    -   Sam

        -   Good question

        -   Both equally desirable but unrelated features

        -   What Yi’s referring to: there are many ways the user can
          enable 3P cookies for an IDP in an RP context outside of
          FedCM (User settings to enable 3P cookies, Heuristics to
          enable 3P cookies, and others)

        -   When that is the case, the IDP has access to track the user

        -   In that case, it is not meaningful for FedCM to maintain a
          higher privacy bar than what is already available by
          presence of 3P cookies.

        -   But other issue is: is it possible for browser to get list
          of accounts through, for example a native app rather than
          via the web?

    -   Tim:

        -   Is it possible to store the device set locally

        -   Surprising number of users who use multiple browser

        -   Similar to: Browser experience for passkeys vs. Platform
          experience for passkeys

    -   Sam:

        -   Yeah that’s different

        -   The more we are thinking of moving things down to the
          platform, the more FedCM starts to look more like the
          IdentityCredential system that is being developed in a
          separate CG\\

    -   Tim:

        -   Yes - and in the IdentityCredential CG there ius talk about
          whether OpenID Connect should just be an instance of
          Identity Credential?

    -   Ben:

        -   Not necessarily good to drop that Privacy Bar

        -   Want to make sure the existence of 3P cookies is seen as
          temporary

        -   Don’t want to have a feature based on temporary features

        -   Want a more permanent solution

    -   Christian

        -   To Tim’s point about storing the connected set at the OS
          level – NOt necessarily anything we’d put in the spec
          because there isn’t any Web Exposed API difference

        -   To Ben’s point about heuristics – Also, this isn’t just for
          heuristics 0- this feature could also work if you got
          Storage Access (eg., vs. SAA)

    -   Sam:

        -   Yes, the Storage Access API works that way in Chrome

        -   If the frame already has 3P cookie access, the
          requestStorageAccess() call auto-resolves

    -   Ben:

        -   But, the user would have had to have direct interaction with
          the browser to have granted SAA in the first place?

    -   Sam:

        -   Yes

    -   Yi:

        -   These 3P cookie access are expected to go away.

        -   So, we’re not intending on using the presence of 3P cookies
          on changing the browser’s view of the association between
          RP and IDP.

        -   So these heuristics are still read-only

        -   And when 3P cookies go away, it will

    -   Ben

        -   Who is reading what?

    -   Yi:

        -   For Auto-Reauthentication, we look for a connected account
          and if none is found, auto-reauthn terminates.

        -   With this new thing, we look for 3P cookie access and if so,
          and IDP says it’s a returning user, it will allow
          auto-reauthn

        -   But later, if the 3P cookies go away, FedCM will look for
          that association and won’t find it, so Auto Reauthn won’t
          work in that case.

    -   Ben

        -   Ok - that seems to make more sense then - not as concerned
          about Privacy concerns now

-   Allow signing in to additional account(s) - [<u>issue
  511</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/511)

    -   Christian

        -   Seems like we discussed this before too

        -   Seems like not much more to discuss here

-   A not-yet logged in IDP has no route to success with this flow -
  [<u>issue 442</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/issues/442)

    -   Tim

        -   A few new comments?

    -   Christian

        -   Yes, this is fro the button flow — adding a parameter
          mode=button vs. mode=widget

        -   If it is a button flow, you would get a sign-in window if
          you weren’t already signed in.

    -   Sam

        -   One delta is that there are now prototypes for both of these
          issues in Chrome Canary today, so if folks could try it
          that would be great!

        -   Flag that controls both of these issues

        -   We can post more instructions on how people could try those

    -   Tim

        -   Flag name?

    -   Sam

        -   Will post instructions after

    -   Christian

        -   FedCMAddAccount flag (for the Add Account functionality)

    -   Phil

        -   Did try it out with Multi-IDP

        -   As it stands button mode is global to all providers in the
          list

        -   Was popping up a separate window for all the providers that
          the browser didn’t think the user was signed into, and
          forced the user to go through the flow for each IDP /
          provider

        -   What is Multi-IDP status?

    -   Sam

        -   Nicolas is about to restart Multi-IDP development

        -   And that is definitely a bug so we’ll capture and fix it

        -   And actively working on Multi-IDP

        -   Working with Achim who needs Multi-IDP which is needed for
          his needs

        -   And we’d welcome other people to partner with

    -   Phil

        -   Yes that would be great – space where there are lots of IDPs
          and how that should work would be great to work on.

-   Webdriver command change - [<u>PR
  510</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/pull/510)

    -   Christian

        -   Change confirm IDP login webdriver command

        -   Wanted to use a more general command which takes each button
          to click

        -   Should not be controversial

        -   But wanted another opinion from other implementers on
          whether this sounds like a reasonable change to continue
          with

    -   Ben

        -   Nothing implemented yet for WebDriver, so seems fine

-   Chrome M120 Announcements

    -   Sam

        -   Lots of follow-on from TPAC discussions earlier this year

        -   M120 ships in Dec 4th

        -   Blog post exists that we will send out with more details

        -   Also, the Login Status API is the first big backwards
          incompatible change for FedCM

    -   Phil (chat)

        -   If released, does that mean Origin Trial ends?

    -   Yi

        -   THere is normally some overlap between Origin Trial and
          Release

        -   Origin Trial customers should get an email with the details

        -   For users who have not upgraded to the latest chrome, the
