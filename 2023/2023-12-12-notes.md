Notes
=====

-   WG Proposal Status

    -   Change requested, still under review, plus some small tweaks to
      make

    -   PR filed on WG charter with some small changes

-   FedCM issues—\#517 (connected account sets)

    -   using heuristics/signals to examine IdPs

    -   blink-dev announcement linked above

    -   no questions

-   FedCM issues—\#467 (cross-site cookie access)

    -   somewhat similar to \#517

    -   idea is to enable 3rd party cookies for IdPs after FedCM process

    -   one API re-enables them via the Storage Access API

    -   proposal to auto-grant access to Storage Access API given FedCM
      grant

    -   hopefully makes process more ergonomical for devs, e.g.,
      Microsoft

    -   Blink devs actively working on this 2024 Q1

    -   can also be seen as a way to relax constraints on 3rd party
      cookies

    -   some questions re: relationship between FedCM and Storage Access
      API

    -   FedCM is a heuristic for the Storage Access API not to prompt
      the user to grant access b/c FedCM already prompted them
      (a/k/a "autogrant")

    -   there's still a mechanism for RPs to opt into/out of this
      (website can apply permission policy to an iframe and disallow
      3rd party cookies if they want to)

    -   still some questions regarding default allow vs. default
      disallow

    -   some pushback from Chrome privacy reviewers

    -   more to come! (prototype being developed)

    -   does the RP default to opt in or opt out? defaults matter from a
      deployment perspective

    -   if on by default, prompts might need more details, with opt in
      helping to limit prompting

-   FedCM issues—\#442 (not-yet-logged-in IdP)

    -   cf. discussion about multiple IdPs

    -   Blink devs currently reviewing corner cases; easier for single
      IdP cases

    -   could be linked with \#240

    -   external discovery would be necessary in R&E use cases (with
      thousands of possible IdPs)

    -   today, multi-IdP behavior is undefined, might be related to
      button flows?

    -   R&E flow: access learning platform, then click to authenticate
      at an IdP, no prior interaction with IdP required

    -   expecting prototype also in 2024 Q1, with origin trials in Q2?

    -   (button flow: A login button for each IdP)

    -   (whereas for R&E: A login button that leads to a multi-IdP
      chooser a/k/a home realm discovery, where are you from?)

-   FedCM issues—\#240 (interaction model)

    -   gated behind enable flag in Chrome

    -   Chrome wants to know if this is the correct direction

    -   BYO IdP: make it work like how email addresses work, RP can take
      any IdP

    -   Can the RP choose who it does trust?

    -   How might RPs, IdPs, CSPs negotiate trust/interaction
      parameters, e.g., attributes, assurances?

    -   RP has to opt in

-   AOB?
