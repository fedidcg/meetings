    -   Zacharias showed Phil Smart's FedCM demos at eduGAIN Town Hall

    -   Are there any updates from Chrome folks? &lt;silence&gt;

    -   Zacharias: last week, Phil talked about the test results about
      the latest iteration. What is the feedback loop on those
      observations?

      Do you have any particular issue in mind?

      this will do?

        -   Nicolas: explainer is in that issue, needs review and
          developer blog posts and MDN documentation is where we
          send developers to help them understand actually shipped
          work items. Can reach out to me via Slack or via my email
          (npm@chromium.org)
