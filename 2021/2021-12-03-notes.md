Notes
=====

\[Heather\] Take a look at the Browser vs Identity session from OSW
earlier this week

Slides (video coming soon):
[<u>OSW2021-Identity\_vs\_Browser.pdf</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kw0eFPogu-FbBU2DkUoGQLH0xpi-6oJd/view?usp=sharing)

\[Heather\] Bringing in a work item doesn’t necessarily mean you fully
support it, especially since it's not done, but you’re willing to
provide feedback

First case - Issue \#13 -
[<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/13</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/13)

\[Beri\] We have 2 use cases

1 - User goes and signed in to IDP

2 - User is not signed in with IDP

Sam - What is the difference between the LMS and the IDP

Beri - IDP and the LMS are not the same.

Sam - Functionality?

Tim - It’s the Learning Management System, not Login MS.

Beri - The input/thoughts from the group for the Case 1 are welcomed

{Group waited for comment/question}

Heather - LMS and MSFT Teams cases are similar.

Tim - Top level LMS sites will likely to redirect

Beri - Looking at the Case \#2, Step 4.

Tim - It redirects from login.microsoft.com to login.microsoftonline.com
and it redirects back to login.microsoft.com, which then redirects to
the initiator.

V: Is the scenario you presented here, in place or is it the plan
(hypothesis) for now?

B: It’s a hypothesis for now. If the HOW is here resonitates you great,
if not we are open to hear the feedback

Peter: Are there cases where the toplevel redirect (ex via
window.top.location.href) is initiated by an iframe?

Vittorio: As functionally, I’ve seen it.

Beri - Session Extension case:
[<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/14</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/use-case-library/issues/14)

Heather - Yes, this is a use case.

It needs a decision, RP and IDP get to decide. Whoever is short wins.
It’s a configurable thing. The timing depends on all directions.

Achim - Silent session (login state) with RP and IDP are different.
There are several different scenarios/details/use cases exist.

Vittorio - Sessions and tokens are different. Confusion on these can
bring security risks.

Sam W - What service/functionality RP wants IDP to provide?

Brian - Silent SSO is something we have been working on a lot.

Sam Goto - Without 3pC, how the thing works on browsers, is it graceful,
or break the flow?

Vittorio - It is not graceful. When it fails, it fails the function.

Example of use of an iframe in redirect based apps to extend the
session:

Heather - Checking if FedCM API can be a work item?

[<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/issues/1</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals/issues/1)

Brian - I’m not going to object to this, but it’s disjoint the 3PCD and
this proposal.

Sam G - I would love to get the specifics. This is one of the many
options we evaluated. There are some pros and cons for each. I don’t
disagree with the sentiment.

Brian May - The concern is this proposal takes the focus from the entire
framework

Heather: Poll results:

<img src="2021-12-03-screenshot1.png" style="width:1.98057in;height:2.97396in" />

Heather - Here is the place to ask questions to provide more
information.

Vittorio - Per the table we (with Tim) worked (seen below), FedCM still
has a bigger scope than the 3pCD. Now, it feels a bit (?)

<img src="2021-12-03-screenshot2.png" style="width:5.33854in;height:2.90027in" />

Sam - We think, the brakages of the 3pcd is smaller. We started in one
place (we have more information), but we are not married to the
solution.

Achim - We need redirect based login where the “car” breaks (referring
the car analogy)

Brian May - Video/deck that was proposed?

Heather - Tim will provide the link for the deck.
